Saying the past weekend was "intense" might have been a slight understatement! Just last weekend, the OWC 2017 Semifinals concluded, where 12 teams went in, and only 6 emerged from the ensuing battle. We have seen some truly magnificent and close matches, and some that displayed almost complete dominance from one side. If you missed all the fun – Worry not if you missed all the fun, we'll walk you through what happened in this week's recap!

Team Hong Kong never saw a shortage of talent. Despite being just a city, Hong Kong kept pumping out amazing players like [Chaoslitz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3621552), [DenierNezzar](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/126144), and [Ming3012](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1583218) over the past years, to name a few. This year, Team Hong Kong ventured far into the OWC, taking down strong opponents left and right before making it to the front of Team Norway. 

At this stage, the Semifinals mappool was putting players to the test, and their skills are being challenged from all directions. Team Hong Kong put up a good fight, but against Norwegian monsters like [CXu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/84841), [-GN](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/895581), and [Afrodafro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3551255), they were denied the ticket to advance. 7-2 was the final score, but there were some seriously close matches that got decided by a matter of some thousands of points! The Norwegian players are anything but easy picking, and even they had to tip their hat to the Hong Kong beasts.

Despite having been taken down by Team Taiwan into the Loser's Bracket, Team Germany never lost their fighting spirit. They are veterans – they've seen huge waves and strong winds, and coming across Team Russian Federation was not something that they feared. Both teams were strong, and were equally at stake – losing in the Loser’s Bracket would mean elimination, and thus neither could really afford that. 

Team Russia played a risky gambit by picking [Oriental Blossom](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/1242790&m=0) (Hidden), one of the highest fail-potential maps in the pool. Both teams realize that in order to beat the other, they have to step out of their comfort zones. However, Team Russia's plan seemed to have backfired, as both teams each had 2 players fail, and Team Germany climbed on top with the combination of the remaining 2 scores.

After making some more trades on points, the scoreboard came to 6-5 in favour of Germany. The pick was theirs, and they decided to go off with a bang by picking [Blue Zenith](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/657917&m=0) (No Mod). Notoriously known for the long streams, this map is undoubtedly a test of stamina. Both sides displayed some amazing prowess, and almost every player reached 4-digits in combo. The score ultimately ended in favour of Germany, and they seal the match with 7-5.

The most intense match of the weekend would have to go to Team South Korea vs Team Brazil. In the beginning, it seemed as if Team South Korea would take this win easily, but Team Brazil was most definitely not afraid of this Asian powerhouse, playing the match to their hearts’ content. The early lead was taken by the Brazilians quite convincingly, and it seemed as if the Koreans lost their momentum they were so known for in tournaments. 

Soon, the match came down to a 6-3 in favour of Team Brazil, and everyone was ready for the match to come to an end soon. However, the Korean busdrivers decided that they would not accept the results, and riding on the backs of the PP Brothers – [Pray](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2190336) and [Pring](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3478883), the South Koreans regained momentum, taking the next 2 points back-to-back.

At this moment, Team Brazil realized that they had to end the match before things get out of control. They picked [Yoru Naku Usagi wa Yume wo Miru](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/178645&m=0) (Free Mod), a map with extremely high fail potential near the end and also highly dependent on one's consistency. Speaking of consistency, the Koreans did not look like this was their weekend, and so Brazil naturally attempted to go in and capitalize on that. As the map was coming to an end, the final stream tripped up [Mystia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4277702) on the Brazilian side, causing him to fail and giving the point over to South Korea – 6-6, tiebreaker time! For the first and only time this weekend, [Fleshbound](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/1131747&m=0) was played.

Going into the tiebreaker, Team Brazil showed no sign of backing down. [MouseEasy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1558603) – the ever-dependent carry, remained steadfast as an example for his team to follow. On the Korean side, Pring stepped up to take on the challenge, and both teams clashed head-on in a fight that would go down in everyone's memories. What everyone expected to be a segmented combo fight turned out to be quite the extraordinary as Pring maintained combo through one hard section after another – reaching that absolutely unexpected FC! South Korea took the match 7-6, and Brazil sure did put up a great fight!

To conclude the weekend, Team Poland and Team UK met in the Winner's Bracket. Both teams were eyeing for that ticket to face Team USA on the Winner's Finals, but only one may advance. Neither side appeared to be less favoured, and the expectation was that the match would be close. Team UK is full of monsters – [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050), [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983), [Jameslike](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2415743), to name a few. 

Team Poland, on the other hand, is just a vodka-powered tank, crushing everything in its path. This team had came close to taking home an OWC Champion title many times, but every time it was so close and yet so far. This year, it appeared that both teams intended on making it their year.

The match started in the fashion many expected – teams trading off points, and many maps came down to the wire when players who failed or who had missed just one time too many made the difference. Some maps like [I](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/264090&m=0) (No Mod) and [PANIC HOLIC](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/1023481&m=0) (No Mod) came really close, but others see huge score differences that go up to 6-digits. Neither team appeared to be at their A-game today, and soon Poland clutched the match to its first match point with 6-5. 

Team UK, now eyeing for a tiebreaker, had to come out on top on Poland's pick, which was [Viden](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/822166&m=0) (Free Mod). However, the Polish defense line remained strong as the players held onto their combos and grew the score gap just enough so that Team UK would have to overextend. Eventually, the match was locked to 7-5 in favour of Poland.

This coming weekend will be the final weekend of this year's OWC. We start with Team USA and Team Poland having their first engagement in the Winner’s Bracket, on a mappool heralded as the hardest OWC mappool ever. Four other teams would have to fight for their chance in the Loser's Bracket – UK, Germany, Taiwan, and South Korea – all for another chance at the Champion title. 

With anxious hearts we await their fights, and wish all participating players the best of luck. What do you say? Care to join us in witnessing history? Tune in on [Twitch](twitch.tv/osulive) on Friday the 15th at 15:00 UTC and we will see you there!
