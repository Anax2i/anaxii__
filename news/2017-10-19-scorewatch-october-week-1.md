October, the spooky month, has arrived and scores are being set more than ever! We got more 700pp scores, a rustbell classic and more in the first October Scorewatch!

[Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/5182050) is taking his limits to the next level as he snipes a year old score on [MY FIRST STORY - ALONE](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/861381), taking an amazing 99.91% HDHR FC to grab 527pp. To think that he nearly SSed it (got the 1x 100 on the 2nd last note) is amazing enough!

[Rafis](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2558286) has sniped hvick225’s year old score on [Hana - Sakura no Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/827488)! This is Rafis’ 11th 700pp score as he sets an impressive 99.84% HDDT FC on the map, earning 704pp. Get ready for some intense jumping and streaming!

[Cookiezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/124493) has reached the 14,000pp mark with an amazing 99.25% HDHR 1 miss score on [Linkin Park - Guilty All The Same (feat. Rakim)](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1187302?m=0) to earn 726pp. Enjoy 6 minutes of Linkin Park!

[cheewee10](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4477497) sniped WindyS to the number one spot on [gmtn. (witch's slave) - furioso melodia](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/687730) on the 7K difficulty with a painful 99.99% (1 200!) SD FC, earning himself 390pp. Imagine if he put the PF mod instead.

BLAST FROM THE PAST
-----

[rustbell](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/227717) doing what he does best. His 94.78% HDDT FC on DJPop’s [Yuyoyuppe feat. Hanatan - Palette](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/15951) is pretty unbelievable. 270BPM bursts, high note density, and no one has even come close to his score set roughly a year ago. 

Once again, do support [osu!archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/comments/75ev3d/osuarchive_44_rustbell_yuyoyuppe_feat_hanatan/) (it is still ongoing on the osugame reddit), more scores are being churned out as this gets published!

NOTABLE MENTIONS
-----

[Adamqs](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/613592) has taken an impressive 99.44% 2x miss FL score on [Hana - Sakura no Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/827488)! Currently, he is the only player to ever clear the map with FL. There have been many FL plays in osu! history, but this is definitely one of the craziest we will see.

SCORESHOW WITH ZSEIKIMATSU
-----

[\_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6170507) and [asuasu_yura](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2875968) take on each other on the recently ranked osu!taiko marathon, [kamome sano - </emotional>](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1105943).
