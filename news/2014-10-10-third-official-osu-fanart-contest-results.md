Hey there. We received so many awesome entries for the third official osu! fan art contest **"Stickers! So Many Stickers!"** - with the theme of digital stickers (like the ones used on Facebook or Line or other chat programs as large emoticons). Again, the creativity of fans knocked us off our feet; We can definitely see some of these submissions being the perfect way to express osu!-related emotions in chat programs. Well done guys.

Voting has closed, and it's time to announce results. Ready?

The results are broken into two sections, the hard numbers of the public poll results, and the more subjective and personal choices of the staff picks. First place in each section wins a full year supporter tag, along with an osu!tablet (or Pippi plushie, if they prefer). The next four runner-ups in each section will each receive a one-month supporter tag. We've also listed five honorable mentions, who won't be getting prizes but whose art deserves a shout-out here too.

We'll be granting the supporter tags and contacting the first prize winners about the physical prizes in the next few days. If we use any of this art in upcoming merchandise, one of those will be given to the artist as part of the prize as well.
