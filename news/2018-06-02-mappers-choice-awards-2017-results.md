The **[Mapper's Choice Awards](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/734377)** is back again for 2017, and bigger than ever! 

If you're not familiar, the MCA is a voting event where all mappers/modders can nominate and vote what they think is the best map/mapper for each category. 

Our intention is to give a different perspective on the best maps of 2017 through the eyes of the mapping community. We have also expanded our coverage to all four modes instead of just osu!standard, so that everyone can be part of this yearly celebration of mapping!

Voting has concluded recently and we have already announced the winners on stream, but if you happened to miss that, here's a quick recap on the winners of **Mapper's Choice Awards 2017**!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/chata.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/406217)

Coming in hot with the only map in the whole event to clinch the top place for 3 categories, **[Jounzan](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1848318)**'s **[enn](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/406217)** has proven itself to be the undeniable recepient of the Grand Map Award. **enn** simply has it all, from an enchanting storyboard, to a beautiful song, it all comes together to form a truly breathtaking experience. 

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/world-execute.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/470977)

Speaking of storyboards, **[world.execute\(me\)\;](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/470977)** may be one of the flashiest storyboards of all time. Although already faded from the mapping scene, **[Exile-](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2559349)**'s final ranked map may just be his best. A plethora of visual effects that can't be explained in words await you in **[world.execute(me);](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/470977)**, but journey at your framerate's risk!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/eisyo.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/586889) 

Definitely a result one would expect, but still satisfied with nonetheless. **[Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1646397)**'s gigantic set of **[Oriental Blossom](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/586889) ** is the spread to end all spreads. With 22 difficulties, majority stemming from entries of the **[Newspaper Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/570350)**, one can expect a wide variety of gameplay, styles, and experiences! 

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/litvar.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/623972)

One might not even know what this map is, and even upon checking, why it won. But turn that music volume down and you can hear the effort and hard work put behind making the hitsounds of the map absolutely alluring. **[lit(var)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/623972)** definitely won't get your heart pumping, but it'll probably leave you with a smile. 

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/impulse.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/705788)

Anyone with an eye on popular maps has undoubtedly taken notice of **[handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2123087)**'s **[Impulse](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/705788)**. Given its multiple outstanding design concepts and a stellar storyboard, it's no surprise that the map received the highest award in 2 categories. If you haven't given it a try yet, you're definitely missing out!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/dorchadas.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/580215)

Truly one of those maps that is loved both by players and mappers alike. **[Delis](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1603923)** is renowned for his undying devotion to his mapping style, one considered dated by today's community. However, **[Dorchadas](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/580215)** is a prime example of how embracing what you love will always be met with more.  

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/living.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/162800)

**[pw384](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1343783)**'s prescence in the mapping community can be expressed with two terms. Linkin Park & full set marathons. **[Living Things](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/162800)** is the absolute culmination of his efforts with not one, but two difficulties on a song over 30 minutes long. That's what you call a real marathon, folks.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/gekka.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/408745)

 Despite only really mapping a handful of genres, **[PinkHeart](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1269067)**'s maps are certainly beautiful in their own right. **[Gekka Jasmine](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/408745)** is no exception, with his characteristic style creating a smooth, yet thrilling experience for the player.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/handsome.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2123087)

**[handsome](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2123087)**'s accomplishments are nothing to scoff at. Having provided osu! with a wide variety of top-tier Ranked and Loved maps, along with hosting celebratory community mapping events, he's proven himself to be a mapper worthy of the Grand User Award.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/sonnyc.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/11771)

Being a constant in the mapping scene for almost 10 years at this point, it is no wonder that he gets the utmost respect from his peers. **[Sonnyc](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/11771)**'s work in modding has been undisputedly monumental in paving the path for many new mappers and modders alike. 

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/yf.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1243669)

Although more acclaimed as a mapper, **[yf_bmp](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1243669)**'s work as a storyboarder is not overlooked, with masterpieces such as the aforementioned **enn**. His storyboarding style is best described him none other tham himself: 'not just a showoff of effects and particles, but rather an attempt to follow the soul of the music'. 

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/pishi.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3178418)

Already well-known in the scene for his collection of mapping-related videos, it's definitely no surprise to anyone that **[pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3178418)** once again snags the title of 'Outstanding Contribution' for the second year in a row. On top of his videos and QAT work, he has began managing the Mapper's Guild's activites, to bring more official content to the game!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/dsco.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4330511)

A quick glance at his maps, and even his oldest ones would probably make one doubt just how much of a rookie he is. However, **[dsco](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4330511)**'s just that more cultured that everyone else. He has brought a variety of styles and concepts to the table, and not just in terms of maps!

![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/mode_taiko.jpg)

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/encounter.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/474003)

When I played the map for the first time 2 years ago I didn't realize the genius behind it, and it is a bit after while looking at it further in the editor that I realized how incredible it is. It is a perfect representation on how to follow the song's pace while respecting the flow and rhythm of taiko without any additives: no SV or 1/6 snapping pattern, just straight up 1/4. This makes it fun and enjoyable to play even for high end players. Undoubtedly one of **[tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2774767)**'s greatest maps and his best ranked map to this day, any taiko player should try it out at least once.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/next-level.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/623246)

Winning best marathon and electronic map as well as capturing runner-up for Grand Award, **[MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/128993)**'s map of **[NEXT LEVEL](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/623246)** has universally won the respect of taiko mappers and players alike. One only has to play the map once to understand why -- **[MMzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/128993)** captures all the diversity offered by sky_delta and lapix's composition and transforms it into a cohesive playing experience. The relatively lower BPM of the map allows for liberal use of mixed-snapping patterns that play smoothly, keeping the map engaging from start to end.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/matsuri.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/511420)

A well rounded map completely deserving this place on the best spread of 2017. The song's characteristics gave the possibility of creating exotic lower difficulties using blue ticks efficiently. From Kantan to Inner Oni, these rhythmical particularities are well represented, giving both new and seasoned players a good challenge. One of the sets I'd recommend to new players starting taiko, the song and difficulties really sets it apart from the other ranked maps.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/maniera.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/400761)

What makes **[MANIERA]( https://osu.ppy.sh/s/400761)** the most original map of 2017 you ask? Well it’s not about SV changes, hitsounds or storyboard, it’s about every single snapping and patterning choices that **[yu68]( https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6170507)** and his guests have made to make this map enjoyable to play. You don’t need to listen to this song twice to notice how complicated it is to interpret in mapping as it contains many different rhythms, with some that would make the map unplayable if followed accurately. What makes this set even more interesting is that each guest difficulty provides a unique style, resulting in a map that can please any sort of player!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/buriki.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/482486)

**[yu68]( https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6170507)** made his debut in the ranked category in 2017 with his map of **[SymaG's Buriki no Dance](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/482486)**, an energetic utaite cover of a Vocaloid song. The mapset is impressive not only as a first ranked map but also in general -- the spread is made cohesively and the top difficulty flows perfectly, making for a great map to play while jamming along to the music!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/okaerinasai.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/544468)

An incredibly strong mapping force from the start, **[hikikochan](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6512678)** uses her knowledge of music theory to create maps with extreme care put into the structure along with cautiously creating meaningful build-ups that highlight what the song is meant to highlight. Her map **[Okaerinasai (tomatomerde Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/544468)** is no exception to this, and the effects are only amplified by how well her mapping style compliments the song. With a very rich ascent into the full and satisfying final choruses of this song, the map is undoubtedly a perfect harmony of notes and music.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/sky-of-twilight.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/278403)

This glorious song by Ito Kanako offers many possible ways of mapping it and **[TKS]( https://osu.ppy.sh/u/940878)**'s way was good enough to make it the best Video Game OST map in 2017! The style used here is more oriented towards playability rather than following the song rhythms and melodies in a straightforward way, a kind of style we don’t see much in the ranked section. **[Sky of Twilight]( https://osu.ppy.sh/s/278403)** is a great example of how older mapping styles can stay relevant over the years and this title is well deserved.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/jikininki.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/415048)

**[LZD](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/224335)**'s mapset of **[Whispered's Jikininki](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/415048)** is one that a lot of the taiko community knows for several reasons -- it's a full six-difficulty spread for a song one second under marathon length, and the Inner Oni is a fairly brutal stamina map full of long monocolors in the kiais. Sitting at the top of the Rock & Metal category this year, Jikininki is an example of a mapset whose intensity truly embodies all that the genre has to offer.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/tasuke.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2774767)

It is not common to see one of the best players in a gamemode also being one of the best mappers. **[tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2774767)** is one of these people excelling at both.  His first big impact in the mapping scene was **[Tiger Rampage](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/279175)** in 2015, which was an incredible map for this time. He kept improving after this and regularly posted new sets, a lot being technical maps. Since then, he's been an inspiration to a lot of new mappers (including me) and it is time he finally received recognition for his talent and experience. I'd personally recommend all his sets, although a lot of them are for experienced players, he still has plenty of difficulties for everyone to play. Let's hope he'll keep this pace for the end of 2018 !

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/incandescence.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6256027)

**[incandescence](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6256027)** has certainly made a name for himself in the mapping community this past year as an accomplished modder. Since joining the BNG in the latter part of 2017, he has consistently remained active in promoting the maps he believes in, all the while striving to improve his own modding abilities. His status as the top voted modder this year only goes to show how well hard work pays off!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/nardo.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/876419)

**[Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/876419)** has, for a very long time, been given the title of the most solid mapper by others. With every note having a very specific reason behind its placement, his maps are near flawless and particularly hard to mod due to it. Nardo's mods are also extremely well made, pointing out only what's really needed and offering fantastic suggestions to help. Overall, with such a mapping and modding presence, it's become very hard to not know the mouthful of a name Nardoxyribonucleic.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/fruko.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/7612550)

Bursting into the taiko mapping scene in mid-2017, **[frukoyurdakul](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/876419)** has rapidly established himself as a prolific and proficient mapper. Ranking eight mapsets in the second half of the year alone, he has shown great motivation to improve and establish himself as well as an unparalleled dedication towards some very specific genres: rock and metal. frukoyurdakul also became a Beatmap Nominator not long after his first ranked map, so his future as a prominent member of the mapping community definitely looks bright!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-06-02-mappers-choice-awards-2017-results/kata.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6651672)

It is a bit surprising to see **[katacheh]( https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6651672)** here as he only ranked one map in 2017 and the least we can say is that this map probably did not really influence other mappers. On the other hand, **[katacheh]( https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6651672)** is definitely one of the most impressive gimmick mappers if not the best of 2017 as he completely revolutionized the way of using sliders and SV changes in taiko mapping. If you wish to experience some of his crazy creations I suggest that you check some of his loved maps such as **[Cirno’s Perfect Math Class – Ryu* remix -](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/481441)** and **[Artificial Intelligence : Alpha ~ *GO!!]( https://osu.ppy.sh/s/537827)**.

Among the 100 mapsets, **[On the FM](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/609679)** by **[Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2931883)** and other contributing mappers stood firmly on the podium and is greeted with the Grand Map Award. Featuring a detailed map spread of limit-breaking difficulties with energetic hitsounding style, On the FM proved its ability to bring back the beat and get everyone shaking.

**[Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2931883)** and **[Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/702598)** hit a home run with their award-winning marathon **[Cycle Hit](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/692367)**. This map offers a wide array of patterns with aesthetic designs while maintaining a consistent map structure. An upbeat and compact atmosphere is brought up during the gameplay. This is something that you don’t want to miss out.

The outstanding mapset **[7 Colors](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/612303)** definitely added some colors to the palette of mapping. Pushed to the ranked status single-handedly by **[Sorcerer](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1913190)**, the mapset quality remained exceptional. You may experience precise usage of patterns with impressive flows through the gameplays. The best work from Sorcerer is yet to come.

It's not often you see hybrid sets winning awards, let alone two! This year's MCA featured **[JBHyperion's](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4879508)** difficulties on Ongaku's **[YoiYoi Kokon](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/552854)** taking home two awards for Best Hitsounding and Best Eastern map. With an uplifting song and a more oriental style of hitsounding, combined with nearly flawless usage of CS5 in the Overdose and patterns overall in both difficulties, the map stands above the rest as the only map to win in two categories! Congratulations!

The sky is illuminated by the winning technical mapset **[Arcadia](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/472434)** which is jointly created by **[JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4879508)** and his fellow mappers. Stacked notes, hyperdash chains and accelerated sliders are included in the top difficulty to match the rhythm and bring us an electrifying rave. Other difficulties filled the spread proficiently for everyone to enjoy.

Being the longest mapset by total drain time, **[Hikaru nara](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/519023)** is arguably one of the biggest anime sets crafted for the fruit-catching community. Mild patterns and soothing hitsounds are applied in the difficulties as to develop a serene atmosphere. The picturesque storyboard is also worth mentioning. **[Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2931883)** and contributing mappers endeavored to rank this set, so make sure not to miss it!

The mapping project **[Ultramarine](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/635701)** by **[ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/200768)** and other dedicated mappers was a triumphant success. Tricky difficulty settings, fast-paced movements and flurry of patterns can be found as you are delving into the abyss. The song is also catchy and interesting to play with. Take a deep breath before jumping in!

**[Tokyo Machine - OKAY](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/506237)** by **[WildOne94](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3482692)** is ~~okay I guess~~ more than just ok. No stranger to mapping funky electronic beats, WildOne94 compensates for the low BPM by using large dashes and hyperdashes to really add a sense of energy to this beatmap. Keep an eye out on WildOne94 for more banging electronic bops throughout 2018!

A sip of fruit punch, a welcoming embrace of sea breeze, a wonderful panorama of the horizon, all with the lifestyle of **[Despacito ft. Daddy Yankee](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/665562)**. The difficulties by **[Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2931883)** and **[Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/702598)** appear slightly easier to cater to everyone. To better emphasize the harmonious rhythm, patterns of different snaps and hitsounds are applied masterfully.

Despite being less active later in the year as opposed to earlier, **[JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4879508)** brings home the gold as the Grand User for MCA 2017. His commitment to osu!catch and mapping as a whole cannot be explained enough, being promoted to QAT in mid-2016 and carrying through with that duty even to this day as well as continuing to be a helpful presence in the mapping scene overall with nominations. Needless to say, **[JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4879508)**'s presence throughout the year has been more than enough to land him a spot at the top as this year's Grand User.

**[Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/702598)** is possibly a paragon of mapping to everyone in the community. Spectator never fails to impress all of us with his consistent, aesthetic mapping style, with **[Cycle Hit](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/692367)** and **[Boogie](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/569985)** being the most convincing arguments. Sitting proudly on the throne as the Elite Mapper: Aspirant, Spectator went further to produce top-notch maps with technical elements such as **[Marigold](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/605710)** and **[Stellar](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/699509)**.

An incredibly well deserved winner, **[Nokashi’s](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/5431196)** modding efforts in 2017 were absolutely top tier. With very few maps to call his own, Nokashi has selflessly put his time and effort on osu into improving and polishing other mappers creations instead. With thorough mods, great attention to detail and a very friendly attitude he even became a Beatmap Nominator in late 2017. His overall attitude and dedication is really something that the catch mapping community should be inspired by.

With big names in the limelight, people often forget the little guys behind the scenes. However, it would be a huge understatement to call **[ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/200768)** one of those little guys. Even with taking home the MCA's Outstanding Contribution award, **ZiRoX**'s biggest contributions still go unnoticed to many people. With an insane amount of presence regarding the ranking criteria and managing to maintain a high level of modding in the BNG after 3 years of longstanding contribution, **ZiRoX**'s big win in MCA 2017 should come as a surprise to none if you know the hard work he does. You may not see him on the frontlines of forums, but **ZiRoX** is to thank when it comes to the behind the scenes stuff that helps our mode continue to thrive.

In general try to calculate SV and combine it with the pattern that makes huge audience of players really enjoy it as a fun map and get a massive support as a result is by no means an easy feat for anyone. And yet, here we are with one of the most popular SV map in the mania ranking section that now get almost 600 favourite from players, because of his understanding in develop an intuitively aggressive SV that flows well with the pattern and music without making it too unpredictable and hard to understand and play properly. 

The feedback in Disqus that gives really positive comments and encouragement plus the amount of favourites coming from various levels of players is sufficient than proof that **[Trigger](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/555076)** deserves to be the Grand Winner of 2017.

The amount of layering concept and how solid **[Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4647754)** brings his pattern structure is unbelievably marvelous. **[BLACK OR WHITE?](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/565779)** not only manages to bring diverse skillset for players to test themselves, but also the amount of detail that's been put into each section to maximize the potential of the song itself is remarkably fantastic. And it's not only for the pattern layering, but also with the amount of hitsound sample and combination that's been put into each line and each chord, it is simply a breathtaking display of quality mapping. Definitely a very deserved spot in the marathon category.

At first there were conflicting opinions towards this map because of its fierce SV uses and LN concepts, but finally it is accepted and ranked soon afterwards. Hardly ranked map have implementation of LN patterns throughout the whole map, while maps with fierce SVs are very rare as well. The existence of this map in ranked section remains very special because of its wonderful combination of both rarely-used elements, and 220 bpm also proposes a speed challenge to even those top players. Generally speaking, it's hard to believe that a map of anime song can be created in such an unorthodoxical way, thus winning it the Unorthodox category.

Overall a really intriguing chart with a well deserved spot in this category.

Inspired by **[Wonki](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/7898495)**'s first Zekk map, **[Trigger](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/555076)**, he created another popular mapset featuring quite aggressive SVs and jackhammers. In **[Swampgator](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/613792)**, we can see a development in the variation of SVs used, and how they fit with the patterns and the music in general to make it actually enjoyable to play. With an entry of Spotlight in that month, and quite a noticeable amount of favorites, it's well deserving of an award.

Definitely one of the most popular song just by looking at the amount of plays that its standard counterpart has, and it's clearly not the exception for mania either. **[Tofu1222](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6089608)** manages to bring such an unique touch with the mixing of the piano keysound that further develop the players enjoyment, and not stopping on that, he also uniquely bring his more unorthodox style of pattern approachs in the anime map by putting vocal pitch emphasis into kiai section by layering it into jackhammer. With multiple plus factor that he put into the map, he manages to bring himself into the top spot for the japanese category.

This map definitely makes up a training for stamina, with jumpstreams of 190 bpms mapped throughout the song, but what's more, its variated patterns in vocal part and guitar solo part marks a noticeable characteristic of this map, thus making it a great fit of Western category.

When we talked about the amount of high quality consistency in the mod contribution, **[Protastic101](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6712747)** is undoubtedly one that we must mentioned. It's very occassional seeing someone in their BN era to be really passionate in keep helping new mapper on how they improve and patiently explain in a long length what the mapper must fix to achieve map in a higher quality. She is one of the pioneer that makes the ranked section much more accessible for the new mapper and certainly her contribution really deserves a few words than just an amazement that makes a huge sign in the mania history.

**[Tofu1222](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6089608)** growth in the mapping community is certainly fast when we looked on his first map ranked, and the amount of map he has ranked since. He displays an enormous passion on digging emphasis on various genres of music, and also even started to map in other modes to learn more from them. A clear winner for the Most Promising category.

**[Evening](](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2193881))**'s mapping journey already give a huge insight of what he already accomplished not only in the amount of maps that people already support him, but also on how he brings new concepts to mania not only in ranking section but also to what the mania editor actually capable of. 

A prime example is **[Planet Shaper](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/376293)**, a singularity map that proves the hidden capability of what the mania mapping can do with impressive red line manipulation and the multitude of ideas derived from it. With almost 2 months of work put into it, it goes to show how much passion that he pours into his maps. The last thing is how he continuously helps people from either new or old mappers by handling various level of mapping, and even helping out other modes with timing and storyboards. What he brings and contribute into osu mania is certainly underrated by many, and he really deserves the Most Influential title.
