The osu! Mapping Olympiad marks the return of regularly scheduled beatmapping contests. Starting with the osu! gamemode, we're bringing back beatmapping contests in force! Let's introduce the first contest: Pick one of three songs that suits your fancy.

![](filepath) BANNER IN PROGRESS

After a long hiatus, [Chaos](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2628870), [Voli](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2522275) and [I](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1287964) are happy to announce the revival of official beatmapping contests: Welcome to the _osu! Mapping Olympiad!_

The osu! Mapping Olympiad ensures a mapping contest across all game modes on a regular schedule. It won't be monthly, but it'll be close to that, run by a small team of community members that are just as pumped for more songs to compete on as you are!
To keep things interesting, we have also worked on different kind of contests - so stay tuned in the upcoming months!

### Songs (STILL NEED HELP WITH THE SONG PREVIEWS)

To start off, we are launching this contest with not one, but **three** songs for you to tackle! Showcasing a variety of our Featured Artists, have yourself a listen to the tracks you’ll be taking on:

From one of the most well known artists in osu! comes another upbeat pop track infused with electronic elements that give a dynamic twist: Kuba Oms - Beautiful Uncertainty (Redux)!

Featuring one of osu!'s latest Featured Artists, this is a fast and driving retro video game inspired track: OISHII - Honey Snowflakes!

And last but certainly not least, this laid back track features playful melodies that ride gently over a trance and house inspired groove: cYsmix - Escapism!

There’s going to be something for everyone’s taste - funky rhythms by Kuba Oms, fast-paced goodness by OISHII and some chill beats by cYsmix!

### Ruleset

- This contest is for the **osu!** mode only.
- Each entry must follow the Ranking Criteria.
- Beatmap submissions may contain files up to 15 MB.
- Storyboarding will not be considered in the judging.
- You may submit **one** difficulty for **one** song. Multiple submissions for multiple songs will not be accepted.
- You may collaborate if you like, but only the submitter of each entry will receive credit for judging and prizes.
- Maps submitted to the contest must not be uploaded with the beatmap submission system (BSS) until the contest has concluded and the winners have been announced.
- **Send your finished beatmap as .osu-file to XXX before the deadline expired. Any submissions received after the deadline expired will not be accepted.**

### Judging Criteria

All entries will be judged by the following criteria:

- Musical Relevance (10P) - How well does the entry follow the music with its patterns, its structure and overall concept?
- Creativity (10P) - How unique and/or innovative is the entry in its use of concepts and overall design?
- Technique (10P) - How well does the entry utilize the editor and its tools in its creation? 
- Impression (10P) - How does the judge view the map in its entirety?
- Hitsounding (5P) - How well does the entry utilize hitsounding to emphasize and follow the music?

**Speaking of Judging: We are still looking for capable judges! Are you interested? Feel free to drop a PM to Irreversible with your motivation, knowledge and possible references, where you've already judged. As a compensation, you will receive 2 months of supporter. Please be aware that we can only accept people who do have enough ressources (knowledge, time, reliability) to successfully do this.**

### Prizes

After the entries have been judged and the results finalized, each of the top three maps for each track will receive the following prizes:

- **1st place**: 6 months of osu!supporter, <Olympiad> Winner Badge
- **2nd place**: 4 months of osu!supporter, <Olympiad> Honorable Mention Badge
- **3rd place**: 2 months of osu!supporter, <Olympiad> Honorable Mention Badge

Now, you may be wondering why there is a lack of *Elite Mapper* forum title listed in the prizes. After much deliberation, we felt that granting the *Elite Mapper* title to each song’s top placing entrant would not be doing the prestige of the title enough justice. 

Instead, the *Elite Mapper* title for this contest will be given to the winner of a second contest following this one, which the winning mapper from each track will compete in! 

The winner of this additional contest will be given the honor of becoming osu!’s newest **Elite Mapper** (or special incrementation should they already possess the title)!
_Note: The Title is subject of change._

The contest will remain open for **30 days** from the date of this post. Download the pre-timed .osz files below:
