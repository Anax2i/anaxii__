RLC easily took the top spot at this month's spotlight with this beautiful marathon. Reminding us of RLC's previous masterpieces such as Anhedonia, the music offers a lot of variety and interesting rhythms over the course of more than 10 minutes. Every track of the gapless album is mapped differently, but the map still feels coherent and polished throughout. Totally worth checking out.

sionKotori continues to impress with his newly ranked map, full of very interesting patterns which fit very well with the song and look amazing, other than giving a pretty cool sense of speed. Recommended for everyone who enjoys technical and slider-heavy maps!

Taking a spot in almost every spotlight lately, Delis has made it again. This time, combining the exceptional flow and stunning variety they are known for with an emotional song by Ito Kanako. The mapping perfectly represents the impactful changes of intensity provided by the song. This map is an experience you won't regret!

I see sets like this more and more rarely as time passes, which is a shame. All the four mappers involved in the set did a splendid job in using the unusual doubles in this song and provided (although probably nothing exceptional) a really nice and clean approach to mapping. Overall this mapset is not pretentious at all, but that's most likely the reason why it is here, to demonstrate that not necessarily heavy rhythms or intense jump sessions are important to create an entertaining mapset that hooks the player. Whether you are an expert player or just a casual one you'll have something to chew on considering it is easily DT-able (not sure how many pp it gives tho :P). I could keep praising this mapset for a while but let's say that you should definitely give it a go and witness some old-school mapping modernized for the new standards.

This mapset truly stands out due to the unique spacing and patterning in both difficulties. The flow is smooth but expressive, perfectly supporting the mood of the song. 09kami's and Crystal's maps are on a similar difficulty level, but represent the song in different ways. Check out both of them, you will not regret it!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-may/kokoronashi.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/565432)

Kokoronashi is yet another great mapset contributed by pishifat. Playing the map feels unique, since it avoids rotational flow and focuses entirely on back-and-forth or linear patterns. You should definitely check this one out if you haven't yet!

A calm, beautiful winter song with a very good-looking skin and a very well designed mapset. While the top difficulty is quite spammy in terms of object density, the visual aspect of the map does not fall apart! Combined with great lower difficulties, this mapset deserves to be featured in the spotlights.

Spooky! Just 7 months after Halloween Hanjamon's Classic Pursuit entered the ranked section, and what a great map it is! Featuring a huge variety of Slider Velocity changes, tricky off-beat patterns, consistency (which does not equal boring) and even 1/8, this map offers a lot of things to enjoy. And if the map is too easy for you: Try it with ANY mod. It's a challenge with Hidden, Hardrock and Doubletime, with the variety of Slider Velocities and complex 1/4+1/8 keeping you on your toes no matter what mod you are using. The set also has nicely done lower diffs, including Hanjamon's signature "Basic" difficulty, which introduces you into the most basic structures of osu!taiko's dons and kats (the red and blue notes!). We hope that you will enjoy this map - and replay it during Halloween!

What a high quality set brought up by tasuke912 and SKSalt this month ! What made this chart get featured in the Spotlights is the management of a flawless structure, patterning and flow in each of their respective difficulties, really making a contrast with some other ranked maps this month. tasuke912's pair patterns usage and rhythm changes in the Inner Oni is the signature of a very highly experienced beatmapper, representing the song extremely accurately while making it fun to play through flow and hitsounding.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-april/on-the-fm.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/568544)

This month we have something different in the chart, a gimmick map! Tired of maps with regular sv? Do you want to play maps with constant sv changes? On the FM it's your map! But hey, we are talking of the Inner Oni, right? No! You will have a sv challenge in all diffs, even in the Kantan. Nofool did a good choice with this song as the sv changes fits pretty well and gives a lot of variety, since 1/4 patterns to nonstop 1/3 patterns. What? Too slow? Use HR and you will enjoy more the map!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-april/clarity-(feat-foxes).jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/603069)

A bright song and map that I would like to mention in this month, it doesn't contained any fancy patterns,but rather clean in overall. Although the usage of hitsounds is decent, it still not the most decisive element to make this map perfect. The volume setting is also a important factor that make patterns/hitsounds completely integrated with the song.To sum up, this map mapped in neat way, and the volume/hitsounds usage implies the mapper(hikikochan) comprehends the song itself pretty much.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-april/elpis.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/559260)

After having his [first ever ranked map](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/507007) featured in Spotlights at the start of the year, iloveyou4ever's unique mapping style continues to impress, and his latest map ELPIS certainly showcases his growing creativity and talent as a mapper. This kind of progression is exactly the kind we are looking for, and thus he has earned a rightful spot on this month's Spotlights!

The key defining feature of this map lies in iloveyou4ever's excellent choice of patterns. In particular, his placement of triplets is nothing short of beautiful, as it captures the swell and subtle nuances of the song very well. The streams throughout the map are also fairly varied, carrying good flow in spite of the fluctuating BPM. All in all another excellent addition to the ranked section, and I personally cannot wait to see more from him!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-april/best-way,-best-way.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/316779)

A solid mapset in this month, from Kantan to Muzukashii,Volta did very good job by following a lot of instrument(including vocal) and assigned drum and beat as main role in order to maintain the map's structure, then used other one like vocal to decorate the map to make the map become more fun to play. Moreover, Nardo's Oni also rather decent, every hitsounds usage almost mapped in the best way. After looking how perfect Oni is, I just wonder how Inner Oni can be mapped in good way by expanding the note's density, but I am totally wrong,it indeed contains much more notes expansion and has lot of continuous 1/2+1/4 patterns,but every 1/2 hitsounds are correct mapped and every 1/4 patterns placed in perfect section.Furthermore, Volta used some harder 1/4 pattern to make the map more fun to play.I'd say that I enjoy this map very much!

## osu!catch

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-april/chronoxia.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/429184)

Our top pick is something that many osu!catch players would be familiar with due to it being selected for the osu!catch World Cup 2016's Finals mappool, and is now a fully ranked map. Both the Overdose made by Furely and the Chronos difficulties feature patterns that we don't usually see in most ranked maps - strict antiflow patterns, high overall spacing, and generally a lot of places to miss - while still making it a fun mapset of fair difficulty. Overall, the map is quite challenging for its star rating, being harder than other mapsets people usually see in the Ranked category. It also features several mappers, providing players with different styles across all difficulties. It's quite the engaging map, and one that could surely make you wiggle from joy!

This mapset offers more of what we've come to expect from Ascendance with a well crafted series of difficulties that are a pleasure to play. All difficulties do a nice job of building up to the energetic kiai where the Evanesce difficulty stands out from the rest with its quick doubles that kick the difficulty up a notch. Overall while the mapset may not offer many surprises, its solid execution makes for a welcome addition to the catch spotlights.

Despite of this set is being Myle's very first ranked set it came out to be a really enjoyable one. The spread built up to grew quite constantly. I really enjoyed playing it, he made a good work.

## osu!mania

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-april/trigger-(zekk-remix).jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/555076)

I have to say it. This map is definetly the most fun experience I had in a while from the ranked pool and I can only say thanks and congratulations to Wonki for winning this month spotlights and also for providing us such a good piece. The SVs on this map feels intense but they are not overdone and it just feels natural with the song, making it really confortable to play. Combine that with a cool usage of minijacks at the very end with some simple LN patterns this map just has everything you want to be the map of the month... and its art!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-april/re-lm.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/588066)

This map caught my eye for a few reasons. The most obvious being the heavy use of SV, which is thoughtfully crafted to be intuitive and smooth, which is quite impressive given how easy it is to cross the line of being more of a distraction than a feature. Though the SV is not the main reason I think this map is particularly deserving of a spotlight. Lude doesn't shy away from LN usage in their mapping of this track. Instead, they use it to add atmospheric value, complexity and originality, which is what I personally love to see. These two points combined with some enjoyable jack-oriented mapping and very smooth difficulty curves, makes this a suitable pick for May's spotlight.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-april/black-or-white.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/565779)

Let me introduce you another extreme 7K marathon map by Kawawa. I really like how the map structure flows nicely with the song intensity. From the map itself, i can see the mapper have a really good experience in term of emphasizing the melody itself. What caught my attention is the jacking style pattern in the map which it is pretty new and interesting to see. Besides giving a great pattern usage, the speed change through the map are astonishing extreme and fun. The mapper really did a good job on hightlighting certain beats magnitude with a suitable slider velocity. By advancing through the map, player could easily experience the consciousness of the music along with the note arrangement emphasized by the mapper intention. Have a try while you are on it.

For his 5th ranked map, Frim4503 offers us another 5K marathon, this time for a drum & bass love live opening remix !
As usual we have a mix of LN and chords playing really good, making it a really fun map to try big accuracy scores. SV are really lightly used aswell with a quite unique style, focussing on the voice before each kiai. Without changing much of music/mapping style, Frim4503 show us one more time that anti-meta is not dead with a really accessible and catchy map.

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/media/spotlights2017-april/doppelganger.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/407153)

Apart from having the hardest difficulty ever ranked in osu!mania, it counts with a really enjoyable and challenging patterns in every single difficulty. We also have a few GDs coming from Evening, jakads and Lude. Evening's chart is not really heavily charted, but watch out the svs! They're way more noticeable in this difficulty than in the other ones. Every single mapper and modder has done a really good job checking the pattern's quality and playability of each difficulty (even though alter ego it's hell itself, someone with a good eye can really see how good the patterns fits with the song).

--------

And that just about covers the Spotlights for April. We hope you enjoy the new template graphics for each chart, and we hope you look forward to what we have in store next month as well!
