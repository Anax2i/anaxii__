In celebration of the success of this tournament, let's briefly recount the events that transpired over the past 2 weeks.

### <a name="mappool" id="mappool"></a>Firstly, a word from our Mappool Selectors:

*"With regards to the Finals Mappool, we really don't have an awful lot to say. It's great that what we aimed with the tiebreaker actually happened - we wanted the players to be **ULTRA** nervous on the break because they would be able to see the score difference between the teams. We are certainly happy that the tiebreaker was played despite the unfortunate internet incident.*

*I guess the only thing that was a bit disconcerting was the slight lack of speed picks and the recurring bans on the same maps, but a tiebreaker match more than made up for that (considering it has never happened before!). Overall, it's been a pleasure to have taken part in the map selecting process."*

**The Winners Bracket match saw South Korea face off against the United States, which also ended up in a 6 - 0 victory.** The United States definitely put up a good fight, but the difference in skill was simply too great. South Korea won every point by a significant margin, knocking the US to the Losers Bracket.

**The winners of the first two matches then faced each other, ending up in a 6 - 1 win in favour of Brazil.**
