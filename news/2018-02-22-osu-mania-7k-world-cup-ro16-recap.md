If you've already forgotten the events that have transpired last week, here's a video recap by our beloved [Junihuhn](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4182339) summarising the highlights of the Group Stage.

This week in the Round of 16, we had 8 scheduled "Best-of-9" matches taking place over a Sunday. Teams this week weren't at risk of elimination, though their performance would significantly impact how they progress through the later stages of this tournament.

There were also some fancy new changes to the stream layout - for the first time in World Cup history, the tournament client resolution was not the standard 4:3, but instead an ultrawide 21:9. With double the width, you can be sure that the highlights were twice as exciting!

**This stage, we saw a total of 39 picks and 14 bans across 7 complete matches.**

### A word from our Mappool Selectors:

*"It's alright but the reception we got from certain maps (namely [Falcom Sound Team J.D.K. - Phantasmagoria](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/293691&m=3) and a little from [KOTOKO - agony (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/261515&m=3)) made me think that we didn't do so well because the patterns weren't really the best in those maps, so now we're aiming for something that can make tournament players be wary of a tough map, instead of having them ban a map outright because of it."*

*"The mappool was ok overall, though we might have had a few problems with Ro16 quality-wise and it might have been more unbalanced than usual. We have received a lot of positive feedback and constructive criticism - this will no doubt help us grow as map selectors, and improve the mappools for the later stages."*

### Mappool Statistics:

Picks were fairly balanced across the board, with the exception of [Falcom Sound Team J.D.K. - Phantasmagoria](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/293691&m=3) and [she - gum](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1546340&m=3) - both were banned a total of 6 times each. [she - Is This Love [osu!mania Speedmapping Challenge #5]](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1206690&m=3) was the most popular pick this weekend, having been played in 6 matches.

### Sunday:

Taking place over 2 blocks on the same day, 

***Block 1 (03:00 - 05:00 UTC):***

**The first match of the day was between teams Canada and China, ending in a 0 - 5 sweep.** China was first to pick, opting for [Kola Kid - Spaceman](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/270703#mania/615683), winning by a marginal 27K score. Canada retaliated in turn with [xi - Aragami](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/344198#mania/760452), but despite their best efforts (including a phenomenal 991K FC from [Dawt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2747704)), it was not enough to secure them the win - yielding by a mere 4.9K score. With overwhelming confidece, Team China then proceeded to win the match. A fine performance from both teams.

**The next match saw the United States dominating against Australia in a convincing 5 - 0 victory.** After [a very interesting warmup](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/556800#mania/1178254), the US proceeded to take point after point, with most score differences being in excess of 100K score. Australia put up a good fight on the final pick [xi - .357 Magnum](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/517516#mania/1099592), but the US shot through their dreams, conceding the match.
