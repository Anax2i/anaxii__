The beatmap charts for the March Spotlights can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/chart?ch=MONTH1804) Their respective packs are available at the [Beatmap Pack Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist?t=r) for easier access. **The March 2018 Spotlights rankings will end on 15th May 2018.**

## Past Spotlights results

First of all, congratulations to the winners of the February 2018 Spotlights. They receive one month of supporter status for their efforts!

# Announcing changes in the prizes

**We are happy to announce that from this month onward, we will be rewarding the Top 3 players of each Spotlights leaderboard with special user titles for their efforts!** 

The titles are as follows:

+ **1st place:** Master of *Circles/Drums/Fruits/Piano Keys*
+ **2nd place:** Expert of *Circles/Drums/Fruits/Piano Keys*
+ **3rd place:** Scholar of *Circles/Drums/Fruits/Piano Keys*

We hope that this change will bring about a new level of competition and excitement to the Spotlights Leaderboards, because let's be honest - we're tired of seeing Toy dominate the Spotlights rankings *every single month* for the past year and a half. 

*Note: These user titles are temporary, and will only last for the duration leading up to the announcement of the next cycle of Spotlights winners (~1 month). Thus, these titles will not be awarded retroactively for past Spotlights winners.*

Returning from a long hiatus, [Reisen Udongein](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/232942) makes his comeback by reviving one of his four year old sets - Nekomata Master+'s "squall". The top difficulty, Extra shows off various cursor motions that create a great gameplay experience, while the Another difficulty by Muya creates a true rhythm challenge, showing off the more intricate details of the song.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/happy-halloween.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/692433)

Halloween comes early this year as [Loneight](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/663131) returns with a set of yuikonnu & ayaponzu*'s "Happy Halloween". The map shows off the crazy feel of this song very well, switching between swing beat and normal beats fairly often, and keeping you on your toes for the various SV changes going on. Coupled with wonderful improvised hitsounding, this map definitely brings together a fun experience.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/cosmic-love.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/696222)

Fans of western electronic music won't be left out this month, as the team of [PandaHero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1233255), [La Cataline](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/301279), and [Mirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009) bring forward their mapset of Florence + The Machine's "Cosmic Love". The top difficulty shows off great usage of slow sliders, while the rest of the spread keeps a varied and enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/on-the-backs-of-angels.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/707720)

With his latest ranked map of Dream Theater's "On The Backs Of Angels", [LMT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7262798) manages to find a great balance between playability and capturing the complexity of a nearly 9 minute long progressive metal song.
If you're looking for a map that challenges consistency and finger control, you should definitely give this a try!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/tokei-no-heya.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/508947)

And finally, we have one more beatmap from a_hisa - Tokei no Heya to Seishin Sekai mapped by [Asahina Momoko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3650145) and a team of experienced guest mappers! a_hisa is mainly well known for creating spectacular Spiritual Core music and Tokei no Heya to Seishin Sekai is no exception. Complemented by exquisite melody and beats, the song is as engaging as it is emotional.

Momoko has done a great job here on capturing this song through his difficulty, featuring peculiar patterns arranged in a clean and polished fashion which perfectly resonates with every single detail of the song. The rest of Momoko's mapset is not to be neglected either - they are no less expressive when compared to the top difficulty and is definitely worth playing as well!

[![](/wiki/share/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/dum-surfer.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/716193)

This month, [dsco](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4330511) brings us "Dum Surfer" by "King Krule". The mapper managed to take geometrical mapping to a whole nother level by combining it with low approach rate and perfectly overlapping stacks. These give the mapper the freedom to use unorthodox mapping techniques like multiple stacked notes with different distances in time. Combined with a type of song not very common on osu!, this mapset is a unique experience you should not miss out on!

## osu!taiko

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/figue-folle.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/680739)

One of this month's greatest maps, [Kazu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/920861)'s map of Igorrr & Ruby My Dear's "Figue Folle", is also probably one of the most diverse and interesting maps osu!taiko's ranked section has to offer.

Over three and half minutes this map and song challenges the player in many different ways. From unorthodox 1/4+1/6-snap patterns in the beginning, to finisher-heavy sections, to clever usage of kdkdk streams with 1/8 mixed into them, this map never stops to change as the song changes. It's hard to give this map justice through a simple description -  you should simply give this map a try yourself!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/daedalus.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/358799)

You might know the artist Saitama Saisyu Heiki (aka S.S.H.) as the composer of Intersect Thunderbolt which had a great past in osu!taiko. And now, [DarkVortex](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1940325) has successfully brought S.S.H. back to our mode with a great mapset to the song Daedalus!

Featuring several streams mixing the common 1/4 snap with 1/3, as well as consistent and well-done patterns, this map is a incredibly fun to play and, like Figue Folle, is featured in the TWC Finals as a Hard Rock map. This set also is home to six difficulties, while most sets only have four or five, providing a larger range of difficulties to play for players of varying skill levels!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/transport.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/742538)

After being absent from the ranked section for a few months, [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480) returns with an amazing map of  Transport by Sota Fujimori, and let me tell you, it's an AMAZING map.

This is a very technical map, using many odd snaps and rhythms, finishers and slider velocity changes. However, it's also a very enjoyable map and a nice change of pace to the usual "meta", so if you're not afraid of slower maps with tricky patterns, this is a must-play map.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/piccadilly.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/717359)

An outstanding 1/6 map by the new face [lazyboy007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7882675) this month. Despite not having much experience with taiko, he still produced an excellent map with consistent structure. Furthermore, the excellent 1/6 usage and control of pattern density extracts the essence of the song perfectly, making it a worthy contender for this month's Spotlight!

## osu!catch

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/nirvana.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/694025)

Taking the top spot for this edition of the Spotlights is Camellia's rendition of "Nirvana" mapped by [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598)! While being of lower star rating than the usual Camellia map, it features several patterns that make the map harder than it seems.

There's the sort-of stuttery 1/4 slider patterns, the antiflows, and the hyperchains, all of which don't usually appear in most maps. It also manages to take the cake for its design, featuring clean patterns throughout the entire map, utilizing both smooth curves and sharp angles in different parts which reflect the song.

Spectator never fails to impress both players and mappers with his style throughout all the maps he's created, and that is evident in this map.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-03-beatmap-spotlights-march-2018/element-of-spada.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/485733)

Finally making it's long-overdue arrival in the Ranked section, [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)'s "Element of SPADA" is a prime example of the beauty of simplicity. Without attempting any particularly radical patterning or quirky rhythm choices, this approval-length beatmap still manages to interest and challenge the player, continuously shifting and evolving throughout. Perhaps more importantly, its also an absolute joy to play through.

After previously producing one of the most dramatic and exhilarating matches of the osu!catch World Cup 2017, it's great to see such a memorable and high quality beatmap given the spotlight it deserves for all to experience.

## osu!mania

**The Spotlights team did not find a map they felt was worthy of the Spotlights this month, so there will be no competition for this mode.**

We hope you enjoy our selection for this month and look forward to what we will bring to you in the future.

Until then, happy clicking, drumming, catching, and hitting the piano notes! Do not forget to have a rest occasionally!
