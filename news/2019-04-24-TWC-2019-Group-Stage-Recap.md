The sound of thundering drums marks the return of the osu!taiko World Cup, ready to march onwards for its 9th instalment. We've come a long way since our inception in 2011 - long gone are the days where multiple country teams run rampant, with dominating performances from the likes of both Japan Team A and B, and curious oddities such as the great Italy/Netherlands Alliance of 2011-2013.

This year is special in the sense that it is the first time the osu!taiko World Cup has had 32 unique countries pariticpating in a battle for the very top. With the addition of 8 teams from last year and an upgrade from Best-of-7 to Best-of-9 matches, last weekend's Group Stage was almost thrice as grand (and busy) as any before it - a momentous occasion and a cause for celebration for all osu!taiko fans and supporters alike. 

Without further ado, let's get right into the Group Stage. 

## <a name="mappool" id="mappool"></a>Mappool
**Last weekend, we saw a total of 278 picks and 96 bans across 48 complete matches.** Every map was (to the joy of the mappool selectors) played at least 10 times, and feedback from the players was generally very positive.

### A word from our Mappool Selectors:

"You're short" - mango

“weff" - Nwolf

"sorry for my absence" - tasuke912

### Mappool Statistics:

**This week's most picked map was [Morimori Atsushi + Verdammt - Le Fruit Defendu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/808011#taiko/1695684), having been played in 31 out of 48 matches!** [MiddleIsland - Delrio](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/917573#taiko/1916185), [Warak - Cosmic Invaders](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/765624#taiko/1978335) and [dj MAX STEROID - Arabian Rave Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/592980#taiko/1254592) were all tied at 36 interactions (picked + banned) each, making them the most popular/influential maps this stage.

**Conversely, [Shano x 40mP - Sanpo Michi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/62991#taiko/186452) holds the title of most banned map of the week, with 18 bans to 17 picks.** Understandably, it was clear that many teams didn’t want to risk tackling the devilishly tricky 120BPM map on Hidden. Finally, [CyoucyoP feat.Hatsune Miku - End of the World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/215476#taiko/506018) received the least attention at 16 interactions - 10 picks and 6 bans. A bit disappointing, but the map has made more than its fair share of appearances in past TWCs - it’s certainly not the end of the world as the song would otherwise suggest.

## <a name="ahead" id="ahead"></a>Looking Ahead: Round of 16

**Next week we'll be treated to a total of 8 exciting matches, and you can find the schedule on the [TWC 2019 wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2019#match-schedule:-round-of-16).** As it is a double elimination format, the Round of 16 is unique in the sense that no team is at risk of being eliminated, though their performance will determine how the remainder of the matches play out in future stages. 

**The first match of the RO16 Stage will take place Saturday 11:00 UTC, 27th of April.** There we will see a much anticipated match between two veteran countries - Japan vs. France. Be sure to catch the stream on the [osu!live twitch channel!](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive). 

**Finally, here's a reminder to buy your banners today!** In addition to expressing your support for a chosen team, your contribution will also go towards funding the prize pool for this tournament. You can purchase the banners [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/ABC).
