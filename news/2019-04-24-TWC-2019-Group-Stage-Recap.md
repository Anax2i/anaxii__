[General notes abou twc this year] Super basic facts? 

The Group Stage 

## <a name="mappool" id="mappool"></a>Mappool
**Last weekend, we saw a total of 278 picks and 96 bans across 48 complete matches.** Every map was (to the joy of the mappool selectors) played at least 10 times, and feedback from the players was generally very positive.

### A word from our Mappool Selectors:

“

### Mappool Statistics:

**This week's most picked map was [Morimori Atsushi + Verdammt - Le Fruit Defendu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/808011#taiko/1695684), having been played in 31 out of 48 matches!** [MiddleIsland - Delrio]https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/917573#taiko/1916185), [Warak - Cosmic Invaders](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/765624#taiko/1978335) and [dj MAX STEROID - Arabian Rave Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/592980#taiko/1254592) were all tied at 36 interactions (picked + banned) each, making them the most popular/influential maps this stage.

**Conversely, [Shano x 40mP - Sanpo Michi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/62991#taiko/186452) holds the title of most banned map of the week, with 18 bans to 17 picks.** Understandably, it was clear that many teams didn’t want to risk tackling the devilishly tricky 120BPM map on Hidden. Finally, [CyoucyoP feat.Hatsune Miku - End of the World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/215476#taiko/506018) received the least attention at 16 interactions - 10 picks and 6 bans. A bit disappointing, but the map has made more than its fair share of appearances in past TWCs - it’s certainly not the end of the world as the song would otherwise suggest.

That concludes all the matches for now! Let's wave our goodbyes to the 16 teams that were narrowly defeated last weekend - we thank you for participating and hope to see you again next year. Good luck to all the remaining teams in this tournament!

## <a name="ahead" id="ahead"></a>Looking Ahead: Round of 16

Next week marks the start of the Elimination Stages, where teams compete in the familiar double-elimination bracket format. The Round of 16 is unique in the sense that no team is at risk of being eliminated, though their performance will determine how the remainder of the matches play out in future stages. 

**The first match of the RO16 Stage will take place Saturday 11:00 UTC, 27th of April.** There we will see a much anticipated match between two veteran countries - Japan vs. France. Be sure to catch the stream on the [osu!live twitch channel!](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive). We'll be treated to a total of 8 exciting matches next weekend, and you can find more about the schedule on the [TWC 2019 wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2019#match-schedule:-round-of-16)

**Finally, a reminder to buy your banners today!** In addition to expressing your support for a chosen team, your contribution will also go towards funding the prize pool for this tournament. You can purchase the banners [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/ABC).
