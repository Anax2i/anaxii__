The sound of thundering drums marks the return of the osu!taiko World Cup, ready to march onward for its 9th installment. We've come a long way since our inception in 2011 — long gone are the days where multiple country teams run rampant, with dominating performances from the likes of both Japan Team A and B, and curious oddities such as the great Italy-Netherlands Alliance of 2011-2013.

This year is special in the sense that it is the first time the osu!taiko World Cup has had 32 unique countries pariticpating in a battle for the very top. With the addition of 8 teams from last year and an upgrade from best-of-7 to best-of-9 matches, last weekend's Group Stage was almost thrice as grand (and busy) as any before it — a momentous occasion and a cause for celebration for all osu!taiko fans and supporters alike.

Without further ado, let's get right into the Group Stage!

## <a name="mappool" id="mappool"></a>Mappool
**Last weekend, we saw a total of 278 picks and 96 bans across 48 complete matches.** Every map was (to the joy of the mappool selectors) played at least 10 times, and feedback from the players was generally very positive.

### Some words from our Mappool Selectors

*"Honestly, we're very happy with how the mappool performed throughout last weekend. Player reception was extremely warm, with particular praise towards song diversity. You'll be glad to know that we fully intend to keep these standards up moving forward!"*

*"Learning from last year, we decided to reduce the NoMod pool from five maps to four, and increase the FreeMod pool from two maps to three. This was done to tailor NoMod to being less attractive as an option, and encouraging players to go for mods more often. This was a success, and you can see the distribution on the TWC stats sheet. The increase from best-of-7 to best-of-9 also reduced the incidence of sweeps which were all too prevalent last year, but at the same time reduced the potential for tiebreaker matches. Imagine our surprise and delight when we were able to witness two of those on stream!"*

### Mappool Statistics

**This week's most picked map was [Morimori Atsushi + Verdammt - Le Fruit Defendu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/808011#taiko/1695684), having been played in 31 out of 48 matches!** [MiddleIsland - Delrio](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/917573#taiko/1916185), [Warak - Cosmic Invaders](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/765624#taiko/1978335) and [dj MAX STEROID - Arabian Rave Night](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/592980#taiko/1254592) were all tied at 36 interactions (picked + banned) each, making them the most popular/influential maps this stage.

**Conversely, [Shano x 40mP - Sanpo Michi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/62991#taiko/186452) holds the title of most banned map of the week, with 18 bans to 17 picks.** Understandably, it was clear that many teams didn’t want to risk tackling this devilishly tricky 120 BPM map on Hidden. Finally, [CyoucyoP feat.Hatsune Miku - End of the World](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/215476#taiko/506018) received the least attention at 16 interactions (10 picks and 6 bans). It's a bit disappointing, but the map has made more than its fair share of appearances in past TWCs; it's certainly not the end of the world as the song would otherwise suggest.

Over the course of last weekend, we saw our fair share of surprise performances from newcomer and veteran teams alike. Since it would be impossible to go through every single match in detail, here are some of the highlights below!

### Saturday
**The first match on the stream saw the unseeded China squaring off against the top-seeded Australia, resulting in a nail-bitingly close result of 3 — 5!**. osu!mania extraordinaire and Team Captain [Wilben_chan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6659363) surprised us all with his skill on the drums, landing many high accuracy scores alongside [7jasmine](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4112195) to secure an early lead of 2 — 0. Australia was taken by surprise, but remained focused and proceeded to turn the tide as the match went on. A monumental showing from Team China, and they would later prove their strength again by defeating the low seeded Sweden 5 — 3. 
 
**Italy vs Brazil was one of the most anticipated matches this weekend, ending in a score of 2 — 5 in favour of Brazil.** Both teams' main roster remained largely unchanged from the previous year, though both sides had improved considerably since. With the score hovering at 2 — 2, the match initially seemed dead even at first. However, it was Brazil's diversity in numbers that gave them the winning edge, which Italy couldn't respond to towards the latter half of the match. Nevertheless, both teams have made it through to the next stage, where they may possibly face each other again?

### Sunday

**Chile and South Korea both went the distance, ending in a tiebreaker win for South Korea!** Having only 2 team members present for a 2v2 match is akin to being cornered against a wall. There is no escape - you can only grit your teeth and play to the best of your ability. Faced with insurmountable odds, Chilean Team Captain [Ulqui](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1263669) and his stalwart companion [Alepat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1164931) fought an uphill battle against the top seeded South Korea. With impressive showings from both sides, it wasn't long before the score reached 4 — 4, and the tiebreaker played. In the end, it was South Korea's mod advantage and superior consistency that secured victory. Fortunately for Chile, they have also made it through to the next stage!

**Just 11 hours later, another tiebreaker match broke out between Singapore and Argentina, with Singapore emerging the victor!**. Both teams showed equal tenacity throughout the match, winning on their own respective picks, eventually taking the score to 4 — 4. The tiebreaker was hard fought, with the score flickering many times throughout. However, it was [Lalamomo4](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7609510) and [Element118](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2283992) that emerged victorious, narrowly edging out their Argentinian counterparts with a total score difference of 9,500 points. Many congratulations to Singapore for progressing to the next stage!

**The final match of the day saw Germany vs Canada fighting for the top seed in their group**. With a near-identical roster and a lengthy history of placing on the podium in past years, Team Canada is one of the scariest countries you could ever hope to face in this tournament. Under the fearless leadership of [Ak1o](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1600041), Germany did well to take the first two points of the match. However, Canada quickly recovered and swung the match to 3 — 4. Backed into a corner, Germany's final pick was risky, and it would prove to be fatal - losing by a score difference of only 4,500 points. It really could have gone the other way. Nevertheless, we will be seeing both teams again next weekend!

Let's wave our goodbyes to the 16 teams that were narrowly defeated last weekend. We thank you for participating and hope to see you again next year. Good luck to all the remaining teams in this tournament!

## <a name="ahead" id="ahead"></a>Looking Ahead: Round of 16

**Next week we'll be treated to a total of 8 exciting matches, and you can find the schedule on the [TWC 2019 wiki](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2019#match-schedule:-round-of-16).** As it is a double-elimination tournament, the Round of 16 is unique in the sense that no team is at risk of being eliminated, though their performance will determine how the remainder of the matches play out in future stages.

**The first match of the RO16 Stage will take place Saturday, 27 April at 12:30 UTC.** There we will see a much-anticipated match between two veteran countries: South Korea and United Kingdom. Be sure to catch the stream on the [osu!live Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive)!
