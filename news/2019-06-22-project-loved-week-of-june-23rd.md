We're pretty sure Stefan wasn't even aware of how much of a great map he just made: Necromancer is quite the catchy song and together with his simple, effective mapping it made one of the most fun maps to play both for players that enjoy streamy maps and are just entering the 1/6 meta, and great players who are for sure going to set great scores with Double Time mods. Truly a hidden gem, so make sure to try it out!

Recently, Alchyr has been getting some light as a mapper, and what better map to pick than Camellia - CLOUDY WITH INTERMITTENT RAIN. Despite the rather speedy bpm, Alchyr managed to map this song to be very technical while not being dense, resulting in an experience similar to tech maps at a slower tempo (but this map is at 264 BPM!). There aren't many like this one!

280 BPM, 2:25 | 1.47★ – 7.12★  
*description written by [nyanmi-1828](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6866480)*

マルチプレイをいつもしているプレイヤーなら、"vzk"という名前を一度は見たことがあるでしょう！今回のpickでは、そんな彼が最初に手掛けた譜面である、ATHAZAをNominateします。この譜面は、とても叩きやすいパターンで構成されていますが、長いストリームや1/6が含まれる体力譜面として、人々から愛されています。また、上位譜面をクリアできない人も、比較的低い難易度から挑めるよう、Full mapsetが揃えられています。

If you're a frequent multiplayer player, I bet you've seen the name "vzk" at least once. So for this week's pick, I nominate his very first map, ATHAZA.  
Though this map is mapped using simple patterns, It's loved by the community as a stamina map including long streams and 1/6.  
It's also a full mapset,  so if the top difficulties are too challenging, you can start at the easier ones.

[UNDEAD CORPORATION - Flowering Night Fever](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/414317#taiko) by [Ekoro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/284905)  
290 BPM, 3:52 | 7.58★, 8.24★  
*description written by [nyanmi-1828](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6866480)*

*Note: This map was originally picked in Project Loved: Week of May 5th, but Ekoro wanted more time to update the set, so we removed it from that round's voting. There's also a 2019 version mapped as another difficulty now!*

This week, we have a high-BPM map that even the best may stumble at. This map, which offers many streams at 290 BPM, whittles at the player's stamina without giving any time to recover, making speed and stamina very crucial. Many players use this map for multiplayer and set passing it as their goal. I think all of these aspects make this map one of Ekoro's masterpieces.

上位勢も唸る、高BPM譜面が今週のpickに登場です！BPM290のストリームを叩き続けるこの譜面は、プレイヤーに休憩も許すことなく、体力を削り続けていきます。。。そう、この譜面をプレイするあなたに必要なのは、"体力"と"連打のスピード"でしょう。プレイヤーたちには、マルチやクリア目標としてこの譜面が良く使われています。それもあり、この譜面はEkoroの太鼓譜面の代表作の一つと言えます。

[Momo Meshi - aoyama blue](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/394195#fruits) by [Jervis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1691809)  
226 BPM, 1:01 | 5.94★  
*description written by [Yumeno Himiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1806962)*

As one of the top catch players, Jervis also gave a try in mapping. The map Aoyama Blue goes with a lot of old patterns and edge dashes, which are rarely seen in modern maps. The jumpy patterns along with the streams matches the song as well, however you need to watch out for the spinners since there are tricky notes following after! This is an old-style map, don't miss it!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-22-project-loved-week-of-june-23rd/catch/2-broken-hearts.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/{{TOPIC_ID}})

[eFeL - Broken Hearts](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/461355#fruits) by [ExGon](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/214187)  
100 BPM, 3:42 | 10.56★  
*description written by [Tenshichan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1101600)*

ExGon is known for his bizarre mapping, and this map is no exception. In fact, I would argue that this is one of the most bizarre maps out there. Let's start with the most obvious gimmick: CS10. While it should never be recommended to use such a high CS, in this case, it works really well. The song is very calm and the AR is set to 0, which makes aiming for the fruits doable while still having room for correction. But it is not just the CS - the HP drain is also set to 10 which makes misses very unforgiving. Especially at the end of the map when the song picks up the pace and when fruits occur during spinners, a lot of players will fail. There are also stacked fruits throughout the map which also drain the HP significantly when missed. The map is a difficult reading and precision challenge, so it won't be FCd easily. Although the whole idea sounds ridiculous at first - it is a really fun map, so make sure to give it a try!

[Shiraishi - Shin Sennen Joou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/276927#mania) by [Zyph](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1600432)  
160 BPM, 2:33 | [4K] 4.70★

A fairly popular chart made back in 2016, Zyph's True Millennium Queen is a jack-oriented challenge both for lower-level players and sharpshooters. The chart starts off with light 1/4 handstream, to handstream with hidden 1/4 minijacks, to handstream with more frequent minijacks, to 1/3 (pitch relevant!) moderately dense chordjacking. Zyph's rendition of True Millennium Queen might be more straight-forward than other popular renditions of TMQ, but its linearity is what makes this chart such a compelling chart to play for many. Fancy an accuracy challenge or a rough jack-ridden endeavour? This chart is for you.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-22-project-loved-week-of-june-23rd/mania/2-you-can-recover.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/{{TOPIC_ID}})

[hyi - you can recover](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/566156#mania) by [Valedict](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2537082)  
198 BPM, 2:14 | [4K] 3.87★, [4K] 4.21★, [4K] 4.51★, [4K] 4.81★, [4K] 5.11★

you can recover is a jumpstream chart with varying levels of density. There are occasions where the jumpstream alternates between having a double every 1/2 and a double every 1/1, and there are other occasions in the jumpstream where 2/3rds of the jumpstream are doubles. There are also a few straight-forward breaks in-between jumpstreams with light LN use for certain sounds, which nicely complement the simplicity of the chart. The chart, from a playing perspective, is a pleasant linear accuracy challenge. There are also rates (from 1.1x to 1.4x) for players who want a less precision-focused challenge as well.

From a charting standpoint, the chart has what you would expect from stringent charting (chord allocation, specific patterns being used for specific sets of percussion), but there is also a holistic freeform layering approach to the chart that gives the chart a sense of progression that fits surprisingly well with the song's very own progression. There is one particular repeated section in the song that was layered in two different ways; both of which fit extremely well given what came before those two sections. The combination of you can recover being a fun and gratifying accuracy challenge with an intriguing chart structure makes this mapset one that both charters and players shouldn't pass on.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-22-project-loved-week-of-june-23rd/mania/3-scars-of-fauna.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/{{TOPIC_ID}})

[Nekomata Master - Scars of Fauna](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/846374#mania) by [Raveille](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1388767)  
165 BPM, 1:58 | [4K] 4.61★

A new contender from the osu!mania World Cup 2018 is Scars of Fauna, a smooth, fun, and satisfying LN experience made for anyone with an interest in long notes and complicated release timings. The chart utilizes different densities of LN to represent different sections of the music, as well as, in some cases, even just different sounds, most notably in the chorus where inverse is used as a peak in the buildup of sounds that the song has to offer, making that particular section very satisfying to play. Layered with this satisfaction are the difficult releases strewn throughout, which serve to keep players on their toes for the whole duration of the chart, definitely succeeding in that department. Overall, Scars of Fauna is simply a dynamic, satisfying, and fun arrangement of long notes worthy of this nomination to the Loved Section.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-22-project-loved-week-of-june-23rd/mania/4-promise.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/{{TOPIC_ID}})

[M2U - Promise](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/399373#mania) by [Jinjin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3360737)  
200 BPM, 2:27 | [7K] 5.29★  
The [Easy], [Hard] and [Normal] difficulties are *not* being nominated for Loved.

It's been some time since we got a non-o2 oriented LN chart for loved and for this round, we have Jinjin's Promise. Drawing inspiration from fun elements of O2Jam charting, Jinjin manages to combine a plethora of LN styles ranging from column specific LN groupings, inverses, stylistic reverse shielding, up to 1/4 LN chording at a later section. While not solely restricted to common LN themes, the rice does alternate between bracketing and 1/2 chordtrilling at 200 BPM to chordmashing at the same bpm. Even with the inclusion of patterns that may raise some concerned eyebrows for some just by looks, all these elements come to play in a fashion that's very casual and easy to handle marking this map as a must play for anyone starting to enter into mid-tier LNing.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-06-22-project-loved-week-of-june-23rd/mania/5-checkpoint.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/{{TOPIC_ID}})

[Nitro Fun & Hyper Potions - Checkpoint](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/647297#mania) by [Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)  
140 BPM, 3:00 | [7K] 4.80★

Kawawa makes a comeback to Project Loved with yet another rice oriented chart. Very comfy in nature, Checkpoint is known primarily for being an introductory chart for faster stream patterns which some may call "delay" patterns. While not quite up there in terms of speed, Checkpoint presents very simple but fluid patterning presenting dense 1/4 chordstreaming and chordtrilling with some occasional bracketing followed by 1/8 comfy streaming at 140 BPM. Serving as quite a strong example on how simple charts can be very fun, Checkpoint has earned it place for nomination this round.
