This week's tiebreaker, [AJITAMA Adventure OST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274953#osu/4847546) by [Umeboshi Chazuke](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/98), caught the eyes of many with fine craftsmanship throughout the entire beatmap. In between the usual love and care put into every original with original artwork and storyboarding, the map also had plenty of lore within, containing a bunch of references to the world cup staff, unique dialogue and much more. Originally conceived by [Azer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2155578) and with finer details added by [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718), the combined creativity of them both brought this osu! original a step forward and polished it into a fine piece of art, and Azer was kind enough to share some insight into how it was made:

[AJITAMA Adventure OST](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2274953#osu/4847546) was created with a specific vision in mind. [Umeboshi Chazuke](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/98) has great proficiency in expressing musical stories through their music, and I wanted to capture this idea in a way that suits an OWC tiebreaker.

The storyboard represents a short RPG adventure featuring two of Umeboshi Chazuke's recurring characters, the puppy and the bear. Thanks to [mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718) (who has contributed many special touches in osu! originals), the decision to represent characters as OWC staff was quickly done a day before release, with contributions between myself, [ChillierPear](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9501251), mangomizer, [Librarian](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10083084) & [megumic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7537133).

Referenced by name in the storyboard are Leo the Civilian ([LeoFLT](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3668779)), Evil King Dada ([Dada](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9119507)) & Princess Chiverly ([chiv](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6701656)), three of the hardest working people behind the scenes, ensuring every osu! World Cup runs smoothly. We expanded on this idea significantly by creating special dialogue between the characters making plenty of references to OWC, other staff members & random other prominent things in osu!.

Personally, I think a large amount of staff members that are vital to the success of our event don't really get a lot of public exposure/appreciation, and while we have some other smaller ways to fit those people in somewhere, this was a golden opportunity to immortalize them into a product that they've spent so much passion and effort into. I would particularly like to thank [VenerableNyanta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12243368) for going through the extra effort of adding our silly jokes and references quickly, and I'm very happy that it was well received! Thank you all for showing appreciation for this storyboard.

## Round of 16 summary

The round of 16 weekend has been jam-packed full of exciting matches, with teams both fighting for their survival, or trying to keep the coveted winners bracket spots. Unfortunately the following teams have been eliminated, and have bid farewell to the world cup stage — ::{ flag=AR }:: Argentina, ::{ flag=AT }:: Austria, ::{ flag=BY }:: Belarus, ::{ flag=KZ }:: Kazakhstan, ::{ flag=MY }:: Malaysia, ::{ flag=PE }:: Peru, ::{ flag=SG }:: Singapore, and ::{ flag=ES }:: Spain.

Checking out the winners bracket, we can see that it's been purged of everything but the elite, with the top 10 seeds completely occupying the bracket. However, with it shrinking ever-so slightly every week, we are bound to see some great matches coming from these titans fighting each other for supremacy in the upcoming Quarterfinals this weekend!

Speaking of the top 10 seeds, we got to see a glimpse of what those matches will look like with ::{ flag=CL }:: Chile (#7) vs. the ::{ flag=GB }:: United Kingdom (#10), a match that garnered uncertainty in regard to it's results with a 34/67 [pick'em](https://pickem.hwc.hr/tournaments/158) voting split in favour of the United Kingdom. The match was filled with break points, but in the end the United Kingdom pulled through, did not ruin people's pick'ems, and got away with a score of 5–3.

Continuing on with the pick'ems, in general the community had clear expectations, with no major upsets swindling players from their points. ::{ flag=SG }:: Singapore (#28) vs. ::{ flag=TH }:: Thailand (#21) and ::{ flag=HK }:: Hong Kong vs. ::{ flag=PH }:: the Philippines matches ended in decisive scores of 5–2 and 5–1 respectively, despite the community voting ending in an almost even 50/50 split on both of them.

Let's move onto the highlight matches of the week!

### ::{ flag=RU }:: Russian Federation vs. ::{ flag=CN }:: China

Heading into this week, many a sharp eye was turned to the winners' bracket matchup between the Russian Federation and China. For Russia, it was an opportunity to reach the quarterfinals for the fourth year in a row; meanwhile, China was looking to break through after losing in the round of 16 or earlier in three straight world cups. The two teams had not met since 2021's round of 32, where Russia swept China 5-0; in 2024, China looked to turn the tables as their powerful mid-stage roster faced off against a well-rounded Russian squad.

Both teams came out of the gates firing on all cylinders; China's first pick of DT3 showcased one of the closest maps of the entire match, tightly contested all the way en route to a last-second China win by 42,537 points. Unfazed, Russia picked into their strength in the speed skillset, locking in DT2 for a comfortable win. China backed up their DT3 win with a dominating performance on their second pick HD2, winning by over a million points in one of the most one-sided maps of the entire match.

The first break point would come from a surprising source: Russia picked the tapping-focused FM3 map Perfect Neglect next, but they stumbled badly and China took the upper hand as lolol233 led the way to a win and a 3-1 lead. Their advantage would be short-lived, as Russia performed well and China faltered on NM2, followed by a massive Russian win on their own HR2 pick to tie the match at 3 points apiece, leaving each team with one pick.

China selected the remaining hidden map Escape for their last pick, but it backfired in the worst possible way. Markrum dropped a full combo, three of the four Russian players outscored China's best score by 100,000 points or more, and Russia crushed the pick to win it by 1.2 million, the most one-sided map in the match coming at the worst possible time for China. For their final pick, Russia selected the remaining double time map Sprinter, and what ensued was a nail-biter. China held a narrow lead through much of the map, but into the ending Russia held a combo advantage as seconds counted down; a 200,000 point lead became 100,000, then 50,000, then 15,000 points as the final spinner appeared, but time ran out on Russia as China pulled off a break point to force the tiebreaker.

Tiebreakers have long been a sore spot for Russia. They were eliminated from each of the last three World Cup iterations via tiebreaker, so they had to break their streak of tiebreaker losses to continue in the winners bracket. AJITAMA Adventure set the stage for the climax of this match, and what a climax it was. Back and forth went the combos and back and forth went the score lead as an unbelievably dramatic tiebreaker played out. When the dust finally settled, it was Russia that emerged victorious by a margin of just 102,726 points. With their spot in the quarterfinals secured, the Russian roster could breathe a sigh of relief. They had set up a match with perennial powerhouse Germany, while China could only wonder what could have been as their road diverged to the losers bracket and a matchup against Finland.

## Commentating throughout the years

<div class="news-chat-quote__text-container">

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7944724" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/0x84f.jpg')"></a>

As someone who has participated in OWC for 10 years now either as a player or a commentator, what are the biggest changes that stuck around in your mind even after your extended tenure?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Doomsday.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983">Doomsday</a></p>

The two biggest changes introduced from OWC 2019 come to mind. The removal of the Group Stage was one. I get why the tournament moved away from groups, but I have a real soft spot for them. The tension of close groups, where an individual map win can be the difference between qualifying or not, is something that is lost in the current format.

The other one was the long-awaited ditching of the rule of failed scores not counting, and that was massive. Trust me, OWC players don't need the stress of getting 0 score if they flop on one stream at the end. It was fun to watch, but not so much to play, and it changed the way teams picked maps. Once failed scores counted, teams didn't have to worry about playing it safe with picks, and mappoolers didn't have to worry about that either (not that it stopped them pooling [Dopamine](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/210316#osu/494818) in 2016 though, but you know).

What's one match that you casted that will forever remain ingrained in your memories, what made it special to you?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Doomsday.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983">Doomsday</a></p>

I'm gonna give the cop-out answer and give you two matches. The game that comes to mind has to be the OWC 2017 winner's bracket final, between Poland and the United States. It was (and still is) the most unexpected, ludicrous comeback I've seen in the world cup. Sure, the rule of failed scores not counting did add to the drama, but it made every map in the second half of that game a real nail biter as a spectator. Capping it off with [Tengaku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/336414#osu/816327) as the tiebreaker, arguably the most infamous boss map at the time, was the icing on the cake.

For the sentiment though, it has to be the most recent COE 2024 tournament in the Netherlands, where I had the honour of casting the final with [SadShiba](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10747626). It's hard to describe how incredible it was to cast a top-level match between [Maliszewski](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/12408961) and [Criller](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8116659), with a packed and energetic crowd in front of you reacting in real time. That was something I won't forget in a hurry.

What are your OWC predictions for this year, anyone in specific that you are rooting for besides the home country?

<a class="avatar news-chat-quote__avatar" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983" style="background-image: url('/wiki/shared/avatars/Doomsday.jpg')"></a>

<p class="news-chat-quote__username"><a class="news-chat-quote__colour-fa" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983">Doomsday</a></p>

Aside from the UK crew, I'm good friends with many members of team Norway, so I'd love to see them have a great run this year. Other than that, I'm always rooting for the underdog, and I want to see teams get their best runs to date. We had Peru and Belarus qualify for the Round of 32 for the first time, Spain got pretty close to their first victory in many years vs Finland, and Turkey can have their best run ever if they win vs Taiwan. I gotta root for that.

As for who's taking the title? It's hard to argue against the USA keeping their streak of championships going, but it feels like that position gets more precarious each year. South Korea and Australia are making a strong case for themselves to take that crown. That said, don't count the Brits out just yet, eh?
