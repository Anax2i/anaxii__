Not too many things this week, but the things that I do have for you guys are pretty big! Read on to find out more!

Many people have hoped that osu! would eventually get its own official soundtracks for use with the game. That day is here as a deal was made between the artist cYsmix and osu!, **[leading to some of the very first original soundtracks for use with the game!](http://blog.ppy.sh/post/129936251068/mapping-with-rewards-sep-2015)** That isn’t all either! Any maps that use one of the **[three](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie/cysmix-manic-osu)** **[available](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie/cysmix-house-with-legs-osu)** **[songs](https://soundcloud.com/olemlanglie/cysmix-dovregubbens-hall-new-ver-osu)** can possibly earn a bounty if ranked. This bounty includes $50 osu!store credit, 6 months of supporter, a unique profile badge, and last but certainly not least, bundling of the ranked map into the installer. The list of songs included in the official osu songs may increase over time, so **[you can always out any official songs through the wiki!](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Official_Songs)** Winners of this bounty are at the sole discretion of peppy, so make sure your maps are absolutely amazing if you want to go for this prize! 

**[The 2015 4K Mania World Cup Grand Finals have concluded with the United States coming out on top against the Japan 7-0 to take first place, undefeated throughout the whole tournament!](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/345431)** The United States will walk away with 6 months of supporter, an “osu!mania Champion” user title, osu! merchandise and a profile badge. Japan gets 3 months of supporter and a 2nd place profile badge for their 2nd place position, the United kingdom getting 1 month of supporter and the 3rd place profile badge for making it to the loser bracket finals the previous week. For those who missed the grand final match, I’d recommend checking out the **[VOD](http://www.twitch.tv/osulive/v/17962960)** on twitch!

**[The quarterfinals for the Ausu!Taiko tournament has recently finished!](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/360960&start=0)** **[SpiritsUnite](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/SpiritsUnite)**, **[playtime881](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/playtime881)**, **[andrew000000](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/andrew000000)** and **[TitansHD](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/TitansHD)** all advanced into the winner’s bracket semifinal, with **[mac12321](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/mac12321)**, **[Cutiepiecat](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/Cutiepiecat)**, **[delldo89](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/delldo89)** and **[Synnical](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/Synnical)** dropping into the loser’s bracket. The semifinal map pool is already available in the tournament thread, so check it out if you’re participating or just want some fun taiko maps to play! **[If you’re interested in the rest of the bracket results, you can check them out here](http://challonge.com/AustralianTaiko)**. The semifinals matches are going to be played on October 3rd and October 4th, so **[be sure to check out the stream when the matches are live!](http://www.twitch.tv/australiantaiko)**

**[User card display has now been implemented into the new osu! forums!](http://jizz.ppy.sh/forum)** This new feature can be seen by clicking on your avatar on the top right of the website. This comes from a community contribution made by github user **[claudiodekker](https://github.com/claudiodekker)** following the new **[bounty system](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/issues)** mentioned in previous news posts.

**[The user account appeal system for players who have gotten into trouble with osu! has received the first of the planned changes for an upcoming overhaul.](http://blog.ppy.sh/post/129783482273/20150924)** Players who have attempted the appeal process previously and have not been denied or accepted already are encouraged to resubmit their appeals with the **[new appeal form](https://docs.google.com/a/ppy.sh/forms/d/1PtDknLzpXKSg4uJVgVxAAfFTpDjCnTDRlRkVHxkts8A/viewform)**.

**[This week osu!next has shown us some sneak peeks into the new ranking page layout!](http://next.ppy.sh/post/129830649673/its-sneak-peek-fridays-ill-do-qas-again-for)** The sneak peek images are mostly of **[chart](http://41.media.tumblr.com/4b064aba16c3cd8ab60ef1bc11c7ad70/tumblr_nv7xafuevk1tleiqgo1_1280.jpg)** **[rankings](http://41.media.tumblr.com/3fd45d700c3f0ae3b4d5315c89ae513d/tumblr_nv7xafuevk1tleiqgo2_1280.jpg)**, but it does look like **[regular](http://40.media.tumblr.com/bfe37edd8df12582f4065ae2a787b15b/tumblr_nv7xafuevk1tleiqgo3_1280.jpg)** and **[country rankings](http://36.media.tumblr.com/2632ad698986911748b66d6fcab7164c/tumblr_nv7xafuevk1tleiqgo4_1280.jpg)** are shown as well. Hope you guys are as excited for this new design as I am!

That's all for this week everyone! As always you can send any news you'd like to be represented in the osu!weekly to **[news@ppy.sh](mailto:news@ppy.sh)** and I will do my best to include that information. I do apologize for things being a little later than usual. Hope you all have a good week! Good luck to all who participate in going for ranked for the new cYsmix songs!
