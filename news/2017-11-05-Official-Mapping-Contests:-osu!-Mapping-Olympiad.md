![](filepath) BANNER IN PROGRESS

After a long hiatus, Chaos, Voli and I are happy to announce the revival of official beatmapping contests: Welcome to the _osu! Mapping Olympiad!_

Let me elaborate on the concept for the osu! Mapping Olympiad. To ensure that there is a healthy and consistent flow of official contests, 
we have worked on a concept which involved all types of modes - three contests per mode will happen annually in a specific order. 
To keep things interesting, we have also worked on different kind of contests - so stay tuned in the upcoming months!

### Songs (STILL NEED HELP WITH THE SONG PREVIEWS)

To start off, we are launching this contest with not one, but **three** songs for you to tackle! Showcasing a variety of our Featured Artists, have yourself a listen to the tracks you’ll be taking on:

- Kuba Oms - Beautiful Uncertainty (Redux)
- OISHII - Honey Snowflakes
- cySmix - Escapism

There’s going to be something for everyone’s taste - funky rhythms by Kuba Oms, fast-paced goodness by OISHII and some chill beats by cYsmix!

### Ruleset

- This contest is for the **osu!** (standard) mode only.
- Each entry should follow the Ranking Criteria.
- Beatmap submissions may contain files up to 15 MB.
- Storyboarding will not be considered in the judging.
- You may submit **one** difficulty for **one** song. Multiple submissions for multiple songs will not be accepted.
- You may collaborate if you like, but only the submitter of each entry will receive credit for judging and prizes.
- Maps submitted to the contest must not be uploaded to the BSS until the contest has concluded and the winners have been announced.
- **Send your finished beatmap as .osu-file to XXX before the deadline expired. Any submissions received after the deadline expired will not be accepted.**

### Judging Criteria

We have also slightly reworked the judging criteria to provide a more reasonable judging base. Down below you can see what your map will be judged for:

- Musical Relevance (10P) - How well does the entry follow the music with its patterns, its structure and overall concept?
- Creativity (10P) - How unique and/or innovative is the entry in its use of concepts and overall design?
- Technique (10P) - How well does the entry utilize the editor and its tools in its creation? 
- Impression (10P) - How does the judge view the map in its entirety?
- Hitsounding (5P) - How well does the entry utilize hitsounding to emphasize and follow the music?

**Speaking of Judging: We are still looking for capable judges! Are you interested? Feel free to drop a PM to Irreversible with your motivation, knowledge and possible references, where you've already judged. As a compensation, you will receive 2 months of supporter. Please be aware that we can only accept people who do have enough ressources (knowledge, time, reliability) to successfully do this.**

### Prizes

After the entries have been judged and the results finalized, each of the top three maps for each track will receive the following prizes:

- **1st place**: 6 months of osu!supporter, <Olympiad> Winner Badge
- **2nd place**: 4 months of osu!supporter, <Olympiad> Honorable Mention Badge
- **3rd place**: 2 months of osu!supporter, <Olympiad> Honorable Mention Badge

Now, you may be wondering why there is a lack of *Elite Mapper* forum title listed in the prizes. After much deliberation, we felt that granting the *Elite Mapper* title to each song’s top placing entrant would not be doing the prestige of the title enough justice. 

Instead, the *Elite Mapper* title for this contest will be given to the winner of a second contest following this one, which the winning mapper from each track will compete in! 

The winner of this additional contest will be given the honor of becoming osu!’s newest **Elite Mapper** (or special incrementation should they already possess the title)!
_Note: The Title is subject of change._

The contest will remain open for **30 days** from the date of this post. Download the pre-timed .osz files below:
