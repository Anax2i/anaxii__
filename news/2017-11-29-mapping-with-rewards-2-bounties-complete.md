Never thought you’d see this day, huh? Over two years ago, “Mapping With Rewards” was introduced to the public as a way to reward users who created maps for osu!’s officially licensed music -- namely tracks by [cYsmix](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/2). 

Two rounds of mapping bounties were held: one in [September 2015](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/129936251068/mapping-with-rewards-sep-2015) and another in Halloween themed one in [October 2015](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/132009865043/mapping-with-rewards-oct-2015). The first of those concluded successfully with its mappers rewarded their bounties as promised. The second, however, hadn’t received as much participation and was unfortunately abandoned.

...Until now, that is. A [new round of Mapping With Rewards](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-09-23-mapping-with-rewards-returns) is currently underway, so we’ve brought the old Halloween round back from the dead to reward its mappers their respective bounties!

### The Winners

- Fright March: [Gero’s rendition](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/486142)

- Moonlight Sonata: [Okorin’s rendition](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/486535)

- Classic Pursuit: [-kevincela-’s rendition](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/488238)

Each of these winners were collectively decided by [Desperate-kun](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2202645), [Mir](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/8688812), [-Mo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2202163), [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3178418), and [Pentori](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/7452237).

With this round finally out of the way, we’ll now be able to focus all our attention on the newest round of Mapping With Rewards. There’s [a bit over one month left for your submissions](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/52), so be sure to give it a try if you’re interested in earning some mapping bounties!
