### A word from our Mappool Selectors:

***[juankristal:](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656)*** It's great that what we aimed with the tiebreaker actually happened. We wanted the players to be **ULTRA** nervous on the break because they would be able to see the score difference between the teams (as it turns out there was actually only 1k score difference in the tiebreaker match). I'm certainly happy that the tiebreaker was played despite the unfortunate internet incident. A bit sad that the bans were always the same, but it was expected.

***[Pope Gadget:](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288341)*** We're glad that this pool was considerably diverse, in both beatmap and song variety. It was exciting to see the BR v US match ending up as a tiebreaker match - a first in the history of the osu!mania world cup! Though the stream didn't do the match justice, the extremely small score difference towards and within the break section made the match that much more memorable.

***[Blocko:](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092)*** I thought that the mappool was actually very good, well diversed, with lots of variety here and there. The only thing that was a bit disconcerting was the slight lack of speed picks and the recurring bans on the same maps, but the tiebreaker match more than makes up for that thanks to the hype it brought with the break. Overall, i'm pretty happy to have taken part in the map selecting process.
