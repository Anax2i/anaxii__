### A word from our Mappool Selectors:

***[juankristal:](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443656)*** 

***[Pope Gadget:](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2288341)*** We're glad that this pool was considerably diverse, in both beatmap and song variety. It was exciting to see the BR v US match ending up as a tiebreaker match - a first in the history of the osu!mania world cup! Though the stream didn't do the match justice, the extremely small score difference towards and within the break section made the match that much more memorable.
