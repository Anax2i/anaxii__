The Semifinals offered some very exciting matches, including the first tiebreaker we've seen since Group Stage. Let's walk through them, shall we?

### Semifinals Matches

**The opening match started with Australia eliminating Chile 6-2.** At first, the Australians found themselves in a 1-2 deficit, losing out heavily on the nomods [Revived](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/373517#taiko/818305) and [Out Now On Crowsnest](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/667033#taiko/1411524). All the following picks went in favour of Australia, as the combined strength of [Jaye](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4841352) and [rango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7728466) was too much to handle for the Chileans.

The next team to secure their top 8 placement was **Indonesia with a 6-0 sweep over Brazil.** While some maps were close, Brazil leaves the match empty-handed as they're knocked out of the tournament along with Chile, leaving no Latin American teams left in the cup.

**The European brawl between Spain and Poland ended 6-2 for Spain** [CreepyDuck](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2435013) besting both of the Spaniards on 5 out of 8 maps was simply not enough for Poland. Spain would be the last European team standing, but not for long. 

**Canada versus Hong Kong was the definite highlight of the weekend, ending 6-5 for the Canadians.** The mid-seeded Hong Kong team took everyone by surprise as they took Canada all the way to tiebreaker where they narrowly lost. If you missed this truly spectacular performance, you can rewatch it on the [osulive Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/osulive/videos/all).

**In the winners bracket, Taiwan stopped USA in their tracks with a 6-3 win.**


A few reflections by Australian player [Jaye](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4841352) following the elimination of Australia: 

*This is the first time [Aloda](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1190127) has been captain, and they did a great job of it. The tournament also showed how much [rango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7728466) has grown as a player. I really think they were the highlight of the team, even if our scores say otherwise. As the maps got harder we could show off more of what we could do, especially in Semifinals. When we beat Chile, it felt like a massive weight was lifted not only because we got revenge for last year and Group Stage, but also MWC where they swept the Australian team twice. My best mod is Hidden, but since 2 of our HardRock players were absent I had to limit myself and play the mod I dislike the most. As much as I dislike it as a mod in general, [Jikininki](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/415048/#taiko/899485) is the first map and only map so far to actually make me not only enjoy HardRock, but actually want to play it. Finally, I might as well add that [Nov 29](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/741465#taiko/1564247) was an amazing HD pick and I feel no sympathy towards everyone that struggled on it.*
