      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4890">Quando viene inviata una beatmap, questa viene messa nella sezione &quot;Pending&quot; o nella sezione &quot;Work in Progress&quot;. Queste mappe vengono chiamate comunemente &quot;unranked&quot; (non rankate). Le mappe unranked si differenziano da quelle rankate perché non hanno una tabella dei 50 migliori punteggi e possono finire nella sezione Graveyard dopo un mese di inattività (ovvero che non vengono aggiornate dal creatore da più di un mese). In modo che una mappa abbia la propria tabella dei 50 migliori punteggi deve passare per il processo di approvazione delle beatmap, il Beatmap Approval Process. Prima viene bollata &quot;Bubbled&quot; e poi viene rankata. Solo i [[IT:Beatmap Appreciation Team|BAT]] possono mettere la bolla &quot;bubbled&quot; e, di conseguenza, rankare le mappe.

== Bubble [[File:thinking.gif]]==

Prima che una beatmap possa diventare rankata da un [[IT:Beatmap Appreciation Team|BAT]], deve essere bollata &quot;Bubbled&quot;. Per fare in modo che una mappa possa diventare rankata, deve avere 12 [[IT:Star Priority|Star Priority]] (chiamato anche SP). Puoi ottenere gli SP in due modi. Puoi innanzitutto chiedere agli altri di moddare la tua mappa. Se trovi che la loro mod sia utile al progresso della mappa e gli dai un kudosu, riceverai 1 SP. Inoltre, tu e tutti gli altri utenti che hanno dei [[IT:Kudosu|kudosu]] potete spenderli per dare 1 Star Priority in più. Una volta che una beatmap ha almeno 12 SP, un [[IT:Beatmap Appreciation Team|BAT]] può farla diventare bubbled se la mappa rispetta due condizioni:

# La mappa rispetta il [[IT:Ranking Criteria|Ranking Criteria]]. In poche parole, questo significa che la mappa ha un [[IT:Timing|Timing]] perfetto, ha almeno 2 [[IT:difficulty|difficoltà]] (delle quali una deve essere una [[IT:Easy|Easy]] o una [[IT:Normal|Normal]]), e nel suo complesso deve seguire il ritmo ed essere giocabile.
# La mappa rispetta gli standard di qualità delle mappe che non sono presenti nel Ranking Criteria. Per esempio, se uno slider è un po' brutto, un BAT dovrebbe richiedere un cambiamento ad esso prima di mettere il &quot;bubble&quot; alla mappa.

=== Bubble per le modalità specifiche ===
I bubble per le modalità specifiche (Taiko, Catch the Beat, osu!mania) sono dei bubble applicati ai mapset che presentano difficoltà per modalità specifiche. Il criterio per il bubble di queste mappe varia a secondo il [[IT:Ranking Criteria|Ranking Criteria]] specifico della difficoltà. In ogni caso, i Bubble alle difficoltà specifiche per una modalità devono essere assegnati dai BAT di quella modalità &lt;sup&gt;[Citazione necessaria]&lt;/sup&gt;. Per una lista di tutti i BAT, guarda [[IT:Beatmap_Appreciation_Team#Team_Members|qui]] o [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/p/2430411 qui].

== Popped Bubble [[File:bubblepop.png]] ==

Cambiare una mappa con un bubble causerà il cambiamento dell'icona, dovuto al fatto che necessita di ricevere un bubble di nuovo. Il cambiamento dell'icona può avvenire anche attraverso un BAT il quale non crede che la mappa possa avere il bubble.
Alcuni BAT mettono quest'icona sulla tua mappa mentre la moderano per evitare che un altro BAT moddi la tua mappa, e molto probabilmente dopo quest'icona la mappa sarà rankata.

Nota bene: Se la tua mappa ha un bubble, allora sarà cambiata nell'icona del popped bubble se cambi la mappa e invii i cambiamenti. Se i tuoi cambiamenti non erano drastici (esempio, cambiare solamente una parte di uno [[IT:Hit Objects#Sliders|slider]]), allora chiedi al BAT che gli ha dato il bubble di rimettergli il bubble. La tua mappa guadagnerà 5 [[IT:Star Priority|SP]] per una icona popped bubble.

== Ranked [[File:heart.gif]]==

Una volta che una mappa ha l'icona del bubble, un altro BAT che non sia quello che gli ha dato il bubble può rankare la mappa se rispetta i due criteri detti sopra. La ragione per la quale due BAT sono necessari per il rank della mappa è perché gli esseri umani possono commettere errori, e questo sistema, quindi, riduce di molto il numero di volte in cui una mappa entra nel Ranking con un errore drastico. Se una mappa viene rankata ma entrambi i membri dei BAT non vedono un errore drastico, allora molto probabilmente verrà unrankata (Unranked)

== Unranked [[File:heartpop.gif]]==

Le persone fanno degli errori. Quindi, se una mappa raggiunge il sistema di Ranking con un grave errore, allora diventerà temporaneamente unrankata. Se la mappa viene unrankata, allora si raccomanda di chiedere al BAT che l'ha unrankata il problema nella mappa per poi, di conseguenza, aggiustarlo il più presto possibile per vederla di nuovo rankata.

Nota bene: A volte ti verrà chiesto di cambiare qualcosa che non vorresti cambiare. A volte riuscirai a farla rankare di nuovo senza aggiustare il problema citato dal BAT, ma se più di metà dei BAT approva che tu dovresti cambiarlo, allora dovresti fartene una ragione e aggiustarlo.

Le mappe unranked si differenziano da quelle rankate perché non hanno una tabella dei 50 migliori punteggi e possono finire nella sezione Graveyard dopo un mese di inattività (ovvero che non vengono aggiornate dal creatore da più di un mese). In modo che una mappa abbia la propria tabella dei 50 migliori punteggi deve passare per il processo di approvazione delle beatmap, il Beatmap Approval Process. Prima viene bollata &quot;Bubbled&quot; e poi viene rankata. Solo i [[IT:Beatmap Appreciation Team|BAT]] possono mettere la bolla &quot;bubbled&quot; e, di conseguenza, rankare le mappe.

== Bubble [[File:thinking.gif]]==

Prima che una beatmap possa diventare rankata da un [[IT:Beatmap Appreciation Team|BAT]], deve essere bollata &quot;Bubbled&quot;. Per fare in modo che una mappa possa diventare rankata, deve avere 12 [[IT:Star Priority|Star Priority]] (chiamato anche SP). Puoi ottenere gli SP in due modi. Puoi innanzitutto chiedere agli altri di moddare la tua mappa. Se trovi che la loro mod sia utile al progresso della mappa e gli dai un kudosu, riceverai 1 SP. Inoltre, tu e tutti gli altri utenti che hanno dei [[IT:Kudosu|kudosu]] potete spenderli per dare 1 Star Priority in più. Una volta che una beatmap ha almeno 12 SP, un [[IT:Beatmap Appreciation Team|BAT]] può farla diventare bubbled se la mappa rispetta due condizioni:

# La mappa rispetta il [[IT:Ranking Criteria|Ranking Criteria]]. In poche parole, questo significa che la mappa ha un [[IT:Timing|Timing]] perfetto, ha almeno 2 [[IT:Difficulty|difficoltà]] (delle quali una deve essere una [[IT:Easy|Easy]] o una [[IT:Normal|Normal]]), e nel suo complesso deve seguire il ritmo ed essere giocabile.
# La mappa rispetta gli standard di qualità delle mappe che non sono presenti nel Ranking Criteria. Per esempio, se uno slider è un po' brutto, un BAT dovrebbe richiedere un cambiamento ad esso prima di mettere il &quot;bubble&quot; alla mappa.

=== Bubble per le modalità specifiche ===
I bubble per le modalità specifiche (Taiko, Catch the Beat, osu!mania) sono dei bubble applicati ai mapset che presentano difficoltà per modalità specifiche. Il criterio per il bubble di queste mappe varia a secondo il [[IT:Ranking Criteria|Ranking Criteria]] specifico della difficoltà. In ogni caso, i Bubble alle difficoltà specifiche per una modalità devono essere assegnati dai BAT di quella modalità &lt;sup&gt;[Citazione necessaria]&lt;/sup&gt;. Per una lista di tutti i BAT, guarda [[IT:Beatmap_Appreciation_Team#Team_Members|qui]] o [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/p/2430411 qui].

== Popped Bubble [[File:bubblepop.png]] ==

Cambiare una mappa con un bubble causerà il cambiamento dell'icona, dovuto al fatto che necessita di ricevere un bubble di nuovo. Il cambiamento dell'icona può avvenire anche attraverso un BAT il quale non crede che la mappa possa avere il bubble.
Alcuni BAT mettono quest'icona sulla tua mappa mentre la moderano per evitare che un altro BAT moddi la tua mappa, e molto probabilmente dopo quest'icona la mappa sarà rankata.

Nota bene: Se la tua mappa ha un bubble, allora sarà cambiata nell'icona del popped bubble se cambi la mappa e invii i cambiamenti. Se i tuoi cambiamenti non erano drastici (esempio, cambiare solamente una parte di uno [[IT:Hit Objects#Sliders|slider]]), allora chiedi al BAT che gli ha dato il bubble di rimettergli il bubble. La tua mappa guadagnerà 5 [[IT:Star Priority|SP]] per una icona popped bubble.

== Ranked [[File:heart.gif]]==

Una volta che una mappa ha l'icona del bubble, un altro BAT che non sia quello che gli ha dato il bubble può rankare la mappa se rispetta i due criteri detti sopra. La ragione per la quale due BAT sono necessari per il rank della mappa è perché gli esseri umani possono commettere errori, e questo sistema, quindi, riduce di molto il numero di volte in cui una mappa entra nel Ranking con un errore drastico. Se una mappa viene rankata ma entrambi i membri dei BAT non vedono un errore drastico, allora molto probabilmente verrà unrankata (Unranked)

== Unranked [[File:heartpop.gif]]==

Le persone fanno degli errori. Quindi, se una mappa raggiunge il sistema di Ranking con un grave errore, allora diventerà temporaneamente unrankata. Se la mappa viene unrankata, allora si raccomanda di chiedere al BAT che l'ha unrankata il problema nella mappa per poi, di conseguenza, aggiustarlo il più presto possibile per vederla di nuovo rankata.

Nota bene: A volte ti verrà chiesto di cambiare qualcosa che non vorresti cambiare. A volte riuscirai a farla rankare di nuovo senza aggiustare il problema citato dal BAT, ma se più di metà dei BAT approva che tu dovresti cambiarlo, allora dovresti fartene una ragione e aggiustarlo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">The '''Beatmap Appreciation Team''', formerly known as the Beatmap Approval Team and more commonly referred to as BAT, is a team in charge of [[Ranked Beatmap|ranking beatmaps]]. They also function as community moderators to a limited extent, and act as partner-moderators to many of the [[GMT]] members.

==Roles and Responsibilities==

Members of the '''Beatmap Appreciation Team''' with a predominately red name on the forums (there is no designation between the two in game chat - all BAT are red ingame) are responsible primarily for managing the [[Modding|moderation]] of [[Pending Beatmap|pending beatmaps]] into the ranking cycle. BAT are the people to go to for any modding or advice requests about anything mapping or gameplay related.

==Becoming a BAT==

Becoming a member of the '''Beatmap Appreciation Team''' is often a difficult and drawn-out process. In recent times, the BAT has started taking applications from community members at large at certain intervals throughout the year. Competition through applications is fierce however, and only a handful of BAT are chosen each round. Promising community modders and mappers are often scouted by members of the BAT for internal nomination - referred to as &quot;hand-picking&quot;. Hand-picked BAT are a rare occurrence, usually reserved for the most competent and productive members of the community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1014">'''Mappare''' è il processo necessario per creare [[Beatmap|beatmaps]] in osu!.
Consiste nel scegliere una canzone, il [[tempo]], piazzare oggetti, ed (eventualmente) le [[skin]] e [[Storyboard|lo storyboard]].

I mappatori di solito vogliono che le loro mappe siano nella [[Mappe classificate|Classifica]], che consiste nel processo di [[approvazione delle beatmap]], seguito da un assegnazione della mappa ad un punteggio e prevenire altri aggiornamenti ad essa.

Le più comuni difficoltà in osu! sono:
* [[Facile]]
* [[Normale]]
* [[Dificile]]
* [[Insane]]
Cliccando ogni link verrà mostrato una guida per i [[Mappatori|mappatori]] per essere capaci di creare [[Beatmap|beatmap]] appropriate per ogni [[Difficoltà|difficoltà]].

è anche comune tra i [[Mappatori|mappatori]] usare un nome di [[Difficoltà|difficoltà]] diversa da quelle sopra elencate.

puoi cliccare su [[Guest Difficulty|Guest Difficulty [en] ]] che mostra le altre difficoltà (per esempio Larto's Insane).

=What is &quot;Beatmapping&quot;?=
'''Beatmapping''' is the process of creating beatmaps in osu! for players to play.
It involves choosing a song, [[timing]], placement of objects, and (optionally) [[skinning]] and [[Storyboarding|storyboarding]].

To start, press the '''Edit''' button.

Mappers usually want to get their beatmaps [[Ranked beatmap|ranked]], which consists of a [[beatmap approval]] process, where when completed successfully, a scoreboard will be assigned onto the beatmap and is considered complete unless the mapper wish to add/change something to it.

The most common difficulties created in Beatmapping are:
* [[Easy]]
* [[Normal]]
* [[Hard]]
* [[Insane]]
Clicking each link will display a common set of guidelines [[Mappers|mappers]] follow to be able to create an entertaining beatmap appropriate for its [[Difficulty|difficulty]] level.

It is also not uncommon for [[Mappers|mappers]] to use custom [[Difficulty|difficulty]] names in place of these. (Like &quot;Mario&quot; for example)

Additionally you may find [[Guest Difficulty|Guest Difficulties]] which are commonly labeled as mapper's difficulty (For example Larto's Insane).

With the addition of the Special modes, you can now add mod-specific difficulties to your beatmap other than the usual osu! difficulty. It is entirely possible to fill the beatmap with only Taiko/Catch the Beat/Osu!mania difficulties provided there is an Easy/Normal difficulty in it.

=Getting Started=
==How do I start a new beatmap?==
As osu! is a rhythm based game, the songs you choose to map should have an obvious and constant beat. Try to avoid songs which have tempo (speed) changes or slow songs until you are more experienced and used to the beatmapping mechanism. 

To start a new beatmap, follow these simple steps:-
*Drag and drop the audio file onto osu! (Opened or not is not an issue here) 
:Alternative route: Put audio file onto the &quot;Songs&quot; folder.
:*It should open and direct you to the edit screen with your audio file at there. 
:*Your new song will be at the bottom of the song list, highlighted in purple.
*Click on the song to open up Song Setup. 
**Insert and check that the song title and artist are correct, and add Source and Tags if necessary, then enter in an appropriate difficulty name (Easy, Insane and Cruisin' are examples, you can change it later anyway).
*You can set the other options now if you want, but they can be changed later on. Click OK, and you can start beatmapping! The next step is to add timing to your beatmap.

==How do I time a song properly?==
{{Main|Timing}}
'''Timing is vital - incorrectly timed maps will not be considered for ranking.''' Make sure your timing is perfect before putting any notes in. If in doubt about timing, contact a mod for help first, or submit your song into the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10 Beatmap Help forum]. This will save a ''lot'' of hassle later on. 

Here are some tips for getting your timing right:-
*Watch the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/39317 video] [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/3815/ tutorials] for basic timing methods.
*Make sure the ticks of the metronome coincide with the beat of the song for the entire length of the song. So check the timing at 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the song, at the very least.
*Take a look at the BPM gauge. If the number is very close to a whole number (until .10 difference), it is probably better (unless requested not) to round down to that whole number. If so, manually enter in the correct BPM using the Timing Setup Panel.
**Example: 150.02 should be rounded down to 150.00 unless requested by another mapper that it doesn't sound correct with reason.
*For fine-tuning of the offset, slow the song down to 0.5x (or even 0.25x if necessary) and adjust the values until the beats exactly coincide with the metronome ticks.
*Some songs have multiple BPMs. You can cater for this by adding a timing section (Timing --&gt; Add Timing Section) where the timing changes. The BPM and offset for the new timing section can be found exactly as before. The Timing Setup Panel gives a list of all timing sections in the song.

=Fundamentals of Beatmapping=

|Ctrl + B||'''Add''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Shift + B||'''Remove''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Right Arrow||'''Next''' bookmark.
|-

|}

'''&lt;u&gt;Bookmark is a tool that marks the timeline.&lt;/u&gt;''' This is useful for planning out the specific places where you may want to place a BPM switch point or reserving space to place a complex design later. Depending on your preference, you may abuse this as you play the song while using the command based on the beat as a rough guide on how the beatmap would be.

==Adding normal hit circles==
This should be a straightforward and intuitive process. Below are some useful tips for Normal-type hit objects:-
*The grid level can be changed for more precision by going to View --&gt; Grid Level. Notes will automatically snap to the grid.
**You can override grid snapping and time snapping by holding Shift while performing a move/placement action.
*Right-clicking on a note or a selected group of notes will delete them. Right-clicking elsewhere will toggle a new combo.
*Common Windows shortcuts also apply in the osu! editor (e.g. Ctrl+A selects all notes, Ctrl+C/V is copy/paste, Ctrl+Z is undo).
*Notes will snap to visible sliders - so if you want to place a circle exactly on the end of a slider, place it while you can still see the slider and then move it forward/backward in the timeline if necessary. 

==Adding Sliders==
Before delving into sliders, do the following two things:

*Make sure you set the Slider Velocity (under the Timing tab) to your preferred value. This value will apply for the entire beatmap, so choose carefully! Changing Slider Velocity after placing sliders will result in wonky, mistimed sliders - try and avoid this eventuality!
*Set the type of slider you want. There are two types of curves - Bezier and Linear.
**Bezier is recommended as it produces the smoothest looking curves. 
**Linear mode is useful if you want sharp (e.g. 90 degree) corners in your sliders. 

Now you can begin adding a slider. Left-click to start the slider, add waypoints with further left-clicks, and terminate with a right-click to make a bezier slider. If you want to create a liner slider, make a bezier-shaped slider first, then left-clicking on an existing vertex will turn that vertex red and create a new anchor point to allow for sharp turns and new curves. It is recommended to make sure the length of the slider is correct before adjusting the shape. 

Here are some other tips regarding sliders:-
*To add repeats on a slider, drag the end of the slider in the timeline after finishing placement.
*Drag an individual waypoint to move it. Right-clicking removes a point, and Ctrl+clicking adds a point.
*In the same way as hit circles, you can override any snapping by holding shift. This can be useful for aligning sliders perfectly. 

Try and put some effort into making your sliders look nice! Lopsided/overlapped/wonky/plain-ugly sliders really ruin the look of a beatmap! Additionally, ensure that your sliders do not overlap one another, the tail end of your slider is always visible, and that the slider path is not obscured in any way - such as unpredictable U-turns or making the head and tail of the slider overlap. These slider-crafting pitfalls should be avoided!

==Adding Spinners==
To add a spinner to your map, left-click to begin it, then scroll the timeline to where you want the end to be, and terminate with a right-click. Try and keep your spinners to a reasonable length - overly long spinners are tiring and boring, whilst spinners that are too short are not nice. ^&quot;Spinner spam&quot; (as in, more than 5 spinner in one time) is a definite no-no! 

^&quot;Spinner Spam&quot; note: This is because [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/296 Trans-Siberian Orchestra - Wizards In Winter (Impossible difficulty)] have roughly 48~51 count in ~5 seconds. The beatmap itself contains lengthy streams of hit-circles and perfectly rankable if excluding the ninja spinner spam.

==What are Combos?==
Combos are groups of notes, essential to the scoring in osu!. Different combos have different colours. It is important that you use combos in your beatmaps to ensure better perception and understanding of the song stanza. Typically, combos should be based on the sound (drumming, guitar-streaming, singing) of the music in some way so pay attention to the stanzas displayed in the timing panel if you need some guidance. As a rough guide, a good length of a combo should be around 5-15 excluding streaming (10-30). 

Note: End combos (Geki and Katu specifically) will increase the HP bar by a good amount compared to typical 300. Short combos are preferred since longer combos yield less health in comparison and may cause the beatmap to become unnaturally hard due to HP drain.

==How do I add Breaks into my beatmap?==
To give players a bit of rest time during a longer beatmap, you should include a Break. To do this, simply leave a gap in the beatmap where you want the break to be, and click the &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; button in the editor. Note that you must insert a break between two hit objects, so place notes at the start and end to &quot;mark out&quot; the break before inserting one! 

A couple of rules of thumb are:-
*Generally, try to keep play segments below one minute long. A two minute song should have at least one break in it near the middle, a three minute song should have at least two breaks evenly spaced. This may change depending on the song used. 
*Keep break lengths reasonable. Breaks of less than 1 second are pretty pointless ([http://osu.ppy.sh/b/19842 unless you try to imitate the video game style by summoning warning-arrow]), and breaks of 30 seconds are hardly used and not practical. Try and aim for 5-15 second breaks. 

Here are some advanced tips on planning breaks through the use of Bookmarks:-
*Before you start the map, play through the song and decide where you want the breaks - try include one at regular intervals.
*Use bookmarks to mark out the start and end of each break on the timeline!
*Put in a temporary &quot;marker&quot; (a Normal hitcircle will do) at each bookmark, then click &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; whilst you are in between to add the break.

*An example is shown below:-
[[File:Osu-breaks.png]]
*Note how the breaks are evenly spaced throughout the song and are not too short/long, ensuring the player gets adequate recuperation from their intense clicking marathon, without falling asleep in the meantime! Breaks are displayed as the white brackets on the timeline at the bottom of the editor window.
*Notice the bookmark at the start of the song also, to mark the first note. Bookmarks are useful! Use them to your advantage.

==What is Beat Spacing?==
[[File:Beatspacing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A quick illustration]]
For intuitive play, your beatmaps should have good &quot;beat spacing&quot;! In general, beats that are close together on the timeline should be close together on the beatmap, and vice versa. This is to ensure the flow of the song sync with the beatmap design harmonically, making the beatmap much more enjoyable.

The simplest way to ensure beat spacing is correct on your beatmaps is to utilize the editor's [[Distance Snap]]ping function, found in the upper-right hand side of the editor. The relative distance between notes can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. If you stick to using Distance Snap for the whole song, correct beat spacing is guaranteed!

==How do I add more difficulty levels for a song?==
To make a new difficulty level, simply open your existing difficulty, choose &quot;File&quot; --&gt; &quot;Save As New Difficulty...&quot; and change the entry in the Difficulty box. 

Be sure to add variation between different difficulty levels. Add, take away or rearrange notes to make new patterns. Flip or rotate existing notes. The beatmap difficulties should feel familiar to some degree (like the speed of BPM, BPM change points or certain beatmap design) while ^retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty. 

'''Note:''' Changing the difficulty settings (e.g. HP drain rate) is not considered a new beatmap difficulty. This is called plain laziness, and will likely be requested to create a new beatmap design.

^&quot;retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty&quot;: Difference in beatmap design (as in, no exact repeated flipped design from Easy for Normal). 

==Why do combo numberings change as I play through the song?==
If you have a circle on your mouse cursor (i.e. you are in placement mode) it will act as if you have placed it - changing the combo numbers/colours for any circles that occur after it.

=Visualisation of beatmap=
==How do I change the background colour?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Set BG Colour&quot; which allows you to choose your own background colour. Theoretically speaking, it is most likely to be replaced by background image/video unless you are planning to use a storyboard.

==How do I add a background image or video?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Insert Background&quot;. When clicked, a dialog box will appear, allowing you to browse around your computer for the image or video you want to be added. The image/video will automatically be copied into the song folder, and will be included when submitting your beatmap. 

Some notes:-
*Images can be in .JPG or .PNG format. It is best if you keep them under 800x600 in size. (To save file size)
** Try to compress your images if possible. There are a couple of programs on the internet that can help you.
*Videos should be encoded using DiVX, xvid or similar codecs. Using codecs like H.264 is not recommended.
**Remove the audio of the video to decrease the file size.
*Images and videos can be removed by deleting them from the song folder. 

==How do I add custom images and sounds to my beatmap?==
*Create your desired image/sound file.
*Save it with an appropriate name. 
**Random name: For storyboard. Does exactly nothing when not implemented onto the beatmap.
***Example: A, Lyric1, 007, etc. (As long as you know which one is which one)
**Skin name: The beatmap will use the file automatically, replacing one of the player's skin element. You will notice this. 
***Example: normal-hitnormal (This sound file will be played instead of player skin's sound file)
*Drop it into your song's folder. 

[http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/729/start=0 A list of appropriate custom sound filenames can be found here.] 

==How do I create a storyboard to my beatmap?==
Click the &quot;Design&quot; tab to open up the SBE ([[Storyboard Editor]]).

=What is &quot;Beatmapping&quot;?=
'''Beatmapping''' is the process of creating beatmaps in osu! for players to play.
It involves choosing a song, [[timing]], placement of objects, and (optionally) [[skinning]] and [[Storyboarding|storyboarding]].

To start, press the '''Edit''' button.

Mappers usually want to get their beatmaps [[Ranked beatmap|ranked]], which consists of a [[beatmap approval]] process, where when completed successfully, a scoreboard will be assigned onto the beatmap and is considered complete unless the mapper wish to add/change something to it.

The most common difficulties created in Beatmapping are:
* [[Easy]]
* [[Normal]]
* [[Hard]]
* [[Insane]]
Clicking each link will display a common set of guidelines [[Mappers|mappers]] follow to be able to create an entertaining beatmap appropriate for its [[Difficulty|difficulty]] level.

It is also not uncommon for [[Mappers|mappers]] to use custom [[Difficulty|difficulty]] names in place of these. (Like &quot;Mario&quot; for example)

Additionally you may find [[Guest Difficulty|Guest Difficulties]] which are commonly labeled as mapper's difficulty (For example Larto's Insane).

With the addition of the Special modes, you can now add mod-specific difficulties to your beatmap other than the usual osu! difficulty. It is entirely possible to fill the beatmap with only Taiko/Catch the Beat/Osu!mania difficulties provided there is an Easy/Normal difficulty in it.

=Getting Started=
==How do I start a new beatmap?==
As osu! is a rhythm based game, the songs you choose to map should have an obvious and constant beat. Try to avoid songs which have tempo (speed) changes or slow songs until you are more experienced and used to the beatmapping mechanism. 

To start a new beatmap, follow these simple steps:-
*Drag and drop the audio file onto osu! (Opened or not is not an issue here) 
:Alternative route: Put audio file onto the &quot;Songs&quot; folder.
:*It should open and direct you to the edit screen with your audio file at there. 
:*Your new song will be at the bottom of the song list, highlighted in purple.
*Click on the song to open up Song Setup. 
**Insert and check that the song title and artist are correct, and add Source and Tags if necessary, then enter in an appropriate difficulty name (Easy, Insane and Cruisin' are examples, you can change it later anyway).
*You can set the other options now if you want, but they can be changed later on. Click OK, and you can start beatmapping! The next step is to add timing to your beatmap.

==How do I time a song properly?==
{{Main|Timing}}
'''Timing is vital - incorrectly timed maps will not be considered for ranking.''' Make sure your timing is perfect before putting any notes in. If in doubt about timing, contact a mod for help first, or submit your song into the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10 Beatmap Help forum]. This will save a ''lot'' of hassle later on. 

Here are some tips for getting your timing right:-
*Watch the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/39317 video] [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/3815/ tutorials] for basic timing methods.
*Make sure the ticks of the metronome coincide with the beat of the song for the entire length of the song. So check the timing at 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the song, at the very least.
*Take a look at the BPM gauge. If the number is very close to a whole number (until .10 difference), it is probably better (unless requested not) to round down to that whole number. If so, manually enter in the correct BPM using the Timing Setup Panel.
**Example: 150.02 should be rounded down to 150.00 unless requested by another mapper that it doesn't sound correct with reason.
*For fine-tuning of the offset, slow the song down to 0.5x (or even 0.25x if necessary) and adjust the values until the beats exactly coincide with the metronome ticks.
*Some songs have multiple BPMs. You can cater for this by adding a timing section (Timing --&gt; Add Timing Section) where the timing changes. The BPM and offset for the new timing section can be found exactly as before. The Timing Setup Panel gives a list of all timing sections in the song.

==What information do I enter in Song Setup?==
{{Main|Song Setup#Song and Map Meta Data}}

You should enter this information before you create a second difficulty, to ensure that the description will be consistent across all of the maps in the set. You  are currently '''allowed to use Unicode characters.'''

|'''&lt;u&gt;Keywords to help in searches.&lt;/u&gt;''' Common uses include album names, guest difficulty creators, company name and other terms that may be used by people when searching for specific wants (like eroge or visual novel for example if your beatmap's song is based on an eroge visual novel). If your map has &quot;collab&quot; elements mapped by other mappers, their names can go here. Tags are separated by spaces. It is not compulsory to fill in but is greatly appreciated when using the Web search and osu! search in-game. &lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' If you have a tag of &quot;qwertyuiop&quot; as a tag on your beatmap, you can also find your beatmap in-game by typing in &quot;qwertyuiop&quot;.

'''&lt;u&gt;Bookmark is a tool that marks the timeline.&lt;/u&gt;''' This is useful for planning out the specific places where you may want to place a BPM switch point or reserving space to place a complex design later. Depending on your preference, you may abuse this as you play the song while using the command based on the beat as a rough guide on how the beatmap would be.

==Adding normal hit circles==
This should be a straightforward and intuitive process. Below are some useful tips for Normal-type hit objects:-
*The grid level can be changed for more precision by going to View --&gt; Grid Level. Notes will automatically snap to the grid.
**You can override grid snapping and time snapping by holding Shift while performing a move/placement action.
*Right-clicking on a note or a selected group of notes will delete them. Right-clicking elsewhere will toggle a new combo.
*Common Windows shortcuts also apply in the osu! editor (e.g. Ctrl+A selects all notes, Ctrl+C/V is copy/paste, Ctrl+Z is undo).
*Notes will snap to visible sliders - so if you want to place a circle exactly on the end of a slider, place it while you can still see the slider and then move it forward/backward in the timeline if necessary. 

==Adding Sliders==
Before delving into sliders, do the following two things:

*Make sure you set the Slider Velocity (under the Timing tab) to your preferred value. This value will apply for the entire beatmap, so choose carefully! Changing Slider Velocity after placing sliders will result in wonky, mistimed sliders - try and avoid this eventuality!
*Set the type of slider you want. There are two types of curves - Bezier and Linear.
**Bezier is recommended as it produces the smoothest looking curves. 
**Linear mode is useful if you want sharp (e.g. 90 degree) corners in your sliders. 

Now you can begin adding a slider. Left-click to start the slider, add waypoints with further left-clicks, and terminate with a right-click to make a bezier slider. If you want to create a liner slider, make a bezier-shaped slider first, then left-clicking on an existing vertex will turn that vertex red and create a new anchor point to allow for sharp turns and new curves. It is recommended to make sure the length of the slider is correct before adjusting the shape. 

Here are some other tips regarding sliders:-
*To add repeats on a slider, drag the end of the slider in the timeline after finishing placement.
*Drag an individual waypoint to move it. Right-clicking removes a point, and Ctrl+clicking adds a point.
*In the same way as hit circles, you can override any snapping by holding shift. This can be useful for aligning sliders perfectly. 

Try and put some effort into making your sliders look nice! Lopsided/overlapped/wonky/plain-ugly sliders really ruin the look of a beatmap! Additionally, ensure that your sliders do not overlap one another, the tail end of your slider is always visible, and that the slider path is not obscured in any way - such as unpredictable U-turns or making the head and tail of the slider overlap. These slider-crafting pitfalls should be avoided!

==Adding Spinners==
To add a spinner to your map, left-click to begin it, then scroll the timeline to where you want the end to be, and terminate with a right-click. Try and keep your spinners to a reasonable length - overly long spinners are tiring and boring, whilst spinners that are too short are not nice. ^&quot;Spinner spam&quot; (as in, more than 5 spinner in one time) is a definite no-no! 

^&quot;Spinner Spam&quot; note: This is because [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/296 Trans-Siberian Orchestra - Wizards In Winter (Impossible difficulty)] have roughly 48~51 count in ~5 seconds. The beatmap itself contains lengthy streams of hit-circles and perfectly rankable if excluding the ninja spinner spam.

==What are Combos?==
Combos are groups of notes, essential to the scoring in osu!. Different combos have different colours. It is important that you use combos in your beatmaps to ensure better perception and understanding of the song stanza. Typically, combos should be based on the sound (drumming, guitar-streaming, singing) of the music in some way so pay attention to the stanzas displayed in the timing panel if you need some guidance. As a rough guide, a good length of a combo should be around 5-15 excluding streaming (10-30). 

Note: End combos (Geki and Katu specifically) will increase the HP bar by a good amount compared to typical 300. Short combos are preferred since longer combos yield less health in comparison and may cause the beatmap to become unnaturally hard due to HP drain.

==How do I add Breaks into my beatmap?==
To give players a bit of rest time during a longer beatmap, you should include a Break. To do this, simply leave a gap in the beatmap where you want the break to be, and click the &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; button in the editor. Note that you must insert a break between two hit objects, so place notes at the start and end to &quot;mark out&quot; the break before inserting one! 

A couple of rules of thumb are:-
*Generally, try to keep play segments below one minute long. A two minute song should have at least one break in it near the middle, a three minute song should have at least two breaks evenly spaced. This may change depending on the song used. 
*Keep break lengths reasonable. Breaks of less than 1 second are pretty pointless ([http://osu.ppy.sh/b/19842 unless you try to imitate the video game style by summoning warning-arrow]), and breaks of 30 seconds are hardly used and not practical. Try and aim for 5-15 second breaks. 

Here are some advanced tips on planning breaks through the use of Bookmarks:-
*Before you start the map, play through the song and decide where you want the breaks - try include one at regular intervals.
*Use bookmarks to mark out the start and end of each break on the timeline!
*Put in a temporary &quot;marker&quot; (a Normal hitcircle will do) at each bookmark, then click &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; whilst you are in between to add the break.

*An example is shown below:-
[[File:Osu-breaks.png]]
*Note how the breaks are evenly spaced throughout the song and are not too short/long, ensuring the player gets adequate recuperation from their intense clicking marathon, without falling asleep in the meantime! Breaks are displayed as the white brackets on the timeline at the bottom of the editor window.
*Notice the bookmark at the start of the song also, to mark the first note. Bookmarks are useful! Use them to your advantage.

==What is Beat Spacing?==
[[File:Beatspacing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A quick illustration]]
For intuitive play, your beatmaps should have good &quot;beat spacing&quot;! In general, beats that are close together on the timeline should be close together on the beatmap, and vice versa. This is to ensure the flow of the song sync with the beatmap design harmonically, making the beatmap much more enjoyable.

The simplest way to ensure beat spacing is correct on your beatmaps is to utilize the editor's [[Distance Snap]]ping function, found in the upper-right hand side of the editor. The relative distance between notes can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. If you stick to using Distance Snap for the whole song, correct beat spacing is guaranteed!

==How do I add more difficulty levels for a song?==
To make a new difficulty level, simply open your existing difficulty, choose &quot;File&quot; --&gt; &quot;Save As New Difficulty...&quot; and change the entry in the Difficulty box. 

Be sure to add variation between different difficulty levels. Add, take away or rearrange notes to make new patterns. Flip or rotate existing notes. The beatmap difficulties should feel familiar to some degree (like the speed of BPM, BPM change points or certain beatmap design) while ^retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty. 

'''Note:''' Changing the difficulty settings (e.g. HP drain rate) is not considered a new beatmap difficulty. This is called plain laziness, and will likely be requested to create a new beatmap design.

^&quot;retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty&quot;: Difference in beatmap design (as in, no exact repeated flipped design from Easy for Normal). 

==Why do combo numberings change as I play through the song?==
If you have a circle on your mouse cursor (i.e. you are in placement mode) it will act as if you have placed it - changing the combo numbers/colours for any circles that occur after it.

=Visualisation of beatmap=
==How do I change the background colour?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Set BG Colour&quot; which allows you to choose your own background colour. Theoretically speaking, it is most likely to be replaced by background image/video unless you are planning to use a storyboard.

==How do I add a background image or video?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Insert Background&quot;. When clicked, a dialog box will appear, allowing you to browse around your computer for the image or video you want to be added. The image/video will automatically be copied into the song folder, and will be included when submitting your beatmap. 

Some notes:-
*Images can be in .JPG or .PNG format. It is best if you keep them under 800x600 in size. (To save file size)
** Try to compress your images if possible. There are a couple of programs on the internet that can help you.
*Videos should be encoded using DiVX, xvid or similar codecs. Using codecs like H.264 is not recommended.
**Remove the audio of the video to decrease the file size.
*Images and videos can be removed by deleting them from the song folder. 

==How do I add custom images and sounds to my beatmap?==
*Create your desired image/sound file.
*Save it with an appropriate name. 
**Random name: For storyboard. Does exactly nothing when not implemented onto the beatmap.
***Example: A, Lyric1, 007, etc. (As long as you know which one is which one)
**Skin name: The beatmap will use the file automatically, replacing one of the player's skin element. You will notice this. 
***Example: normal-hitnormal (This sound file will be played instead of player skin's sound file)
*Drop it into your song's folder. 

[http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/729/start=0 A list of appropriate custom sound filenames can be found here.] 

==How do I create a storyboard to my beatmap?==
Click the &quot;Design&quot; tab to open up the SBE ([[Storyboard Editor]]).

=Keyboard Shortcuts=

=What is &quot;Beatmapping&quot;?=
'''Beatmapping''' is the process of creating beatmaps in osu! for players to play.
It involves choosing a song, [[timing]], placement of objects, and (optionally) [[skinning]] and [[Storyboarding|storyboarding]].

To start, press the '''Edit''' button.

Mappers usually want to get their beatmaps [[Ranked beatmap|ranked]], which consists of a [[beatmap approval]] process, where when completed successfully, a scoreboard will be assigned onto the beatmap and is considered complete unless the mapper wish to add/change something to it.

The most common difficulties created in Beatmapping are:
* [[Easy]]
* [[Normal]]
* [[Hard]]
* [[Insane]]
Clicking each link will display a common set of guidelines [[Mappers|mappers]] follow to be able to create an entertaining beatmap appropriate for its [[Difficulty|difficulty]] level.

It is also not uncommon for [[Mappers|mappers]] to use custom [[Difficulty|difficulty]] names in place of these. (Like &quot;Mario&quot; for example)

Additionally you may find [[Guest Difficulty|Guest Difficulties]] which are commonly labeled as mapper's difficulty (For example Larto's Insane).

With the addition of the Special modes, you can now add mod-specific difficulties to your beatmap other than the usual osu! difficulty. It is entirely possible to fill the beatmap with only Taiko/Catch the Beat/Osu!mania difficulties provided there is an Easy/Normal difficulty in it.

=Getting Started=
==How do I start a new beatmap?==
As osu! is a rhythm based game, the songs you choose to map should have an obvious and constant beat. Try to avoid songs which have tempo (speed) changes or slow songs until you are more experienced and used to the beatmapping mechanism. 

To start a new beatmap, follow these simple steps:-
*Drag and drop the audio file onto osu! (Opened or not is not an issue here) 
:Alternative route: Put audio file onto the &quot;Songs&quot; folder.
:*It should open and direct you to the edit screen with your audio file at there. 
:*Your new song will be at the bottom of the song list, highlighted in purple.
*Click on the song to open up Song Setup. 
**Insert and check that the song title and artist are correct, and add Source and Tags if necessary, then enter in an appropriate difficulty name (Easy, Insane and Cruisin' are examples, you can change it later anyway).
*You can set the other options now if you want, but they can be changed later on. Click OK, and you can start beatmapping! The next step is to add timing to your beatmap.

==How do I time a song properly?==
{{Main|Timing}}
'''Timing is vital - incorrectly timed maps will not be considered for ranking.''' Make sure your timing is perfect before putting any notes in. If in doubt about timing, contact a mod for help first, or submit your song into the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10 Beatmap Help forum]. This will save a ''lot'' of hassle later on. 

Here are some tips for getting your timing right:-
*Watch the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/39317 video] [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/3815/ tutorials] for basic timing methods.
*Make sure the ticks of the metronome coincide with the beat of the song for the entire length of the song. So check the timing at 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the song, at the very least.
*Take a look at the BPM gauge. If the number is very close to a whole number (until .10 difference), it is probably better (unless requested not) to round down to that whole number. If so, manually enter in the correct BPM using the Timing Setup Panel.
**Example: 150.02 should be rounded down to 150.00 unless requested by another mapper that it doesn't sound correct with reason.
*For fine-tuning of the offset, slow the song down to 0.5x (or even 0.25x if necessary) and adjust the values until the beats exactly coincide with the metronome ticks.
*Some songs have multiple BPMs. You can cater for this by adding a timing section (Timing --&gt; Add Timing Section) where the timing changes. The BPM and offset for the new timing section can be found exactly as before. The Timing Setup Panel gives a list of all timing sections in the song.

==What information do I enter in Song Setup?==
{{Main|Song Setup#Song and Map Meta Data}}

You should enter this information before you create a second difficulty, to ensure that the description will be consistent across all of the maps in the set. You  are currently '''allowed to use Unicode characters.'''

'''Anime/Game titles or companies do not belong here (they belong to Tags).''' You can usually find the composer for anime and game songs on Wikipedia or other reliable sources such as [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ AnimeNewsNetwork] or [http://myanimelist.net/ MyAnimeList]. Foreign names should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency).
|-
|'''Romanised Artist''' 
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the artist of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency).

|-
|'''Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It will be pulled automatically from the mp3 file, but double check for spelling or capitalization errors, especially if you get the mp3 online. Use only the official title of the song.

|'''&lt;u&gt;That's you. osu! should handle this automatically, so you shouldn't edit this.&lt;/u&gt;''' If you are including a guest difficulty made by someone else, their name belongs in the Difficulty field below, not here.
|-
|'''Difficulty'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the difficulty of map.&lt;/u&gt;''' The dropdown contains the preset names: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane. You can select one of the default names, or create your own name. While it's good to be creative, try to make it very clear which one is harder than others as ambiguous difficulty names can annoy players. This would also be the field where you indicate a guest mapper, if this is their difficulty (e.g. &quot;Larto's Hard&quot;).
|-
|'''Source'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Where this song originate from.&lt;/u&gt;''' This field should generally only be included for Anime or Video Game songs, and occasionally for Novelty (Movies, TV, or Internet) songs. If the song is from an anime or video game, or is famous for its use as a TV or movie theme, the title of that source goes here.&lt;br&gt; Rock and Pop songs should generally leave the field blank. '''This is not to be used for things like album titles.'''
|-
|'''Tags'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Keywords to help in searches.&lt;/u&gt;''' Common uses include album names, guest difficulty creators, company name and other terms that may be used by people when searching for specific wants (like eroge or visual novel for example if your beatmap's song is based on an eroge visual novel). If your map has &quot;collab&quot; elements mapped by other mappers, their names can go here. Tags are separated by spaces. It is not compulsory to fill in but is greatly appreciated when using the Web search and osu! search in-game. &lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' If you have a tag of &quot;qwertyuiop&quot; as a tag on your beatmap, you can also find your beatmap in-game by typing in &quot;qwertyuiop&quot;.

'''&lt;u&gt;Bookmark is a tool that marks the timeline.&lt;/u&gt;''' This is useful for planning out the specific places where you may want to place a BPM switch point or reserving space to place a complex design later. Depending on your preference, you may abuse this as you play the song while using the command based on the beat as a rough guide on how the beatmap would be.

==Adding normal hit circles==
This should be a straightforward and intuitive process. Below are some useful tips for Normal-type hit objects:-
*The grid level can be changed for more precision by going to View --&gt; Grid Level. Notes will automatically snap to the grid.
**You can override grid snapping and time snapping by holding Shift while performing a move/placement action.
*Right-clicking on a note or a selected group of notes will delete them. Right-clicking elsewhere will toggle a new combo.
*Common Windows shortcuts also apply in the osu! editor (e.g. Ctrl+A selects all notes, Ctrl+C/V is copy/paste, Ctrl+Z is undo).
*Notes will snap to visible sliders - so if you want to place a circle exactly on the end of a slider, place it while you can still see the slider and then move it forward/backward in the timeline if necessary. 

==Adding Sliders==
Before delving into sliders, do the following two things:

*Make sure you set the Slider Velocity (under the Timing tab) to your preferred value. This value will apply for the entire beatmap, so choose carefully! Changing Slider Velocity after placing sliders will result in wonky, mistimed sliders - try and avoid this eventuality!
*Set the type of slider you want. There are two types of curves - Bezier and Linear.
**Bezier is recommended as it produces the smoothest looking curves. 
**Linear mode is useful if you want sharp (e.g. 90 degree) corners in your sliders. 

Now you can begin adding a slider. Left-click to start the slider, add waypoints with further left-clicks, and terminate with a right-click to make a bezier slider. If you want to create a liner slider, make a bezier-shaped slider first, then left-clicking on an existing vertex will turn that vertex red and create a new anchor point to allow for sharp turns and new curves. It is recommended to make sure the length of the slider is correct before adjusting the shape. 

Here are some other tips regarding sliders:-
*To add repeats on a slider, drag the end of the slider in the timeline after finishing placement.
*Drag an individual waypoint to move it. Right-clicking removes a point, and Ctrl+clicking adds a point.
*In the same way as hit circles, you can override any snapping by holding shift. This can be useful for aligning sliders perfectly. 

Try and put some effort into making your sliders look nice! Lopsided/overlapped/wonky/plain-ugly sliders really ruin the look of a beatmap! Additionally, ensure that your sliders do not overlap one another, the tail end of your slider is always visible, and that the slider path is not obscured in any way - such as unpredictable U-turns or making the head and tail of the slider overlap. These slider-crafting pitfalls should be avoided!

==Adding Spinners==
To add a spinner to your map, left-click to begin it, then scroll the timeline to where you want the end to be, and terminate with a right-click. Try and keep your spinners to a reasonable length - overly long spinners are tiring and boring, whilst spinners that are too short are not nice. ^&quot;Spinner spam&quot; (as in, more than 5 spinner in one time) is a definite no-no! 

^&quot;Spinner Spam&quot; note: This is because [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/296 Trans-Siberian Orchestra - Wizards In Winter (Impossible difficulty)] have roughly 48~51 count in ~5 seconds. The beatmap itself contains lengthy streams of hit-circles and perfectly rankable if excluding the ninja spinner spam.

==What are Combos?==
Combos are groups of notes, essential to the scoring in osu!. Different combos have different colours. It is important that you use combos in your beatmaps to ensure better perception and understanding of the song stanza. Typically, combos should be based on the sound (drumming, guitar-streaming, singing) of the music in some way so pay attention to the stanzas displayed in the timing panel if you need some guidance. As a rough guide, a good length of a combo should be around 5-15 excluding streaming (10-30). 

Note: End combos (Geki and Katu specifically) will increase the HP bar by a good amount compared to typical 300. Short combos are preferred since longer combos yield less health in comparison and may cause the beatmap to become unnaturally hard due to HP drain.

==How do I add Breaks into my beatmap?==
To give players a bit of rest time during a longer beatmap, you should include a Break. To do this, simply leave a gap in the beatmap where you want the break to be, and click the &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; button in the editor. Note that you must insert a break between two hit objects, so place notes at the start and end to &quot;mark out&quot; the break before inserting one! 

A couple of rules of thumb are:-
*Generally, try to keep play segments below one minute long. A two minute song should have at least one break in it near the middle, a three minute song should have at least two breaks evenly spaced. This may change depending on the song used. 
*Keep break lengths reasonable. Breaks of less than 1 second are pretty pointless ([http://osu.ppy.sh/b/19842 unless you try to imitate the video game style by summoning warning-arrow]), and breaks of 30 seconds are hardly used and not practical. Try and aim for 5-15 second breaks. 

Here are some advanced tips on planning breaks through the use of Bookmarks:-
*Before you start the map, play through the song and decide where you want the breaks - try include one at regular intervals.
*Use bookmarks to mark out the start and end of each break on the timeline!
*Put in a temporary &quot;marker&quot; (a Normal hitcircle will do) at each bookmark, then click &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; whilst you are in between to add the break.

*An example is shown below:-
[[File:Osu-breaks.png]]
*Note how the breaks are evenly spaced throughout the song and are not too short/long, ensuring the player gets adequate recuperation from their intense clicking marathon, without falling asleep in the meantime! Breaks are displayed as the white brackets on the timeline at the bottom of the editor window.
*Notice the bookmark at the start of the song also, to mark the first note. Bookmarks are useful! Use them to your advantage.

==What is Beat Spacing?==
[[File:Beatspacing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A quick illustration]]
For intuitive play, your beatmaps should have good &quot;beat spacing&quot;! In general, beats that are close together on the timeline should be close together on the beatmap, and vice versa. This is to ensure the flow of the song sync with the beatmap design harmonically, making the beatmap much more enjoyable.

The simplest way to ensure beat spacing is correct on your beatmaps is to utilize the editor's [[Distance Snap]]ping function, found in the upper-right hand side of the editor. The relative distance between notes can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. If you stick to using Distance Snap for the whole song, correct beat spacing is guaranteed!

==How do I add more difficulty levels for a song?==
To make a new difficulty level, simply open your existing difficulty, choose &quot;File&quot; --&gt; &quot;Save As New Difficulty...&quot; and change the entry in the Difficulty box. 

Be sure to add variation between different difficulty levels. Add, take away or rearrange notes to make new patterns. Flip or rotate existing notes. The beatmap difficulties should feel familiar to some degree (like the speed of BPM, BPM change points or certain beatmap design) while ^retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty. 

'''Note:''' Changing the difficulty settings (e.g. HP drain rate) is not considered a new beatmap difficulty. This is called plain laziness, and will likely be requested to create a new beatmap design.

^&quot;retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty&quot;: Difference in beatmap design (as in, no exact repeated flipped design from Easy for Normal). 

==Why do combo numberings change as I play through the song?==
If you have a circle on your mouse cursor (i.e. you are in placement mode) it will act as if you have placed it - changing the combo numbers/colours for any circles that occur after it.

=Visualisation of beatmap=
==How do I change the background colour?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Set BG Colour&quot; which allows you to choose your own background colour. Theoretically speaking, it is most likely to be replaced by background image/video unless you are planning to use a storyboard.

==How do I add a background image or video?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Insert Background&quot;. When clicked, a dialog box will appear, allowing you to browse around your computer for the image or video you want to be added. The image/video will automatically be copied into the song folder, and will be included when submitting your beatmap. 

Some notes:-
*Images can be in .JPG or .PNG format. It is best if you keep them under 800x600 in size. (To save file size)
** Try to compress your images if possible. There are a couple of programs on the internet that can help you.
*Videos should be encoded using DiVX, xvid or similar codecs. Using codecs like H.264 is not recommended.
**Remove the audio of the video to decrease the file size.
*Images and videos can be removed by deleting them from the song folder. 

==How do I add custom images and sounds to my beatmap?==
*Create your desired image/sound file.
*Save it with an appropriate name. 
**Random name: For storyboard. Does exactly nothing when not implemented onto the beatmap.
***Example: A, Lyric1, 007, etc. (As long as you know which one is which one)
**Skin name: The beatmap will use the file automatically, replacing one of the player's skin element. You will notice this. 
***Example: normal-hitnormal (This sound file will be played instead of player skin's sound file)
*Drop it into your song's folder. 

[http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/729/start=0 A list of appropriate custom sound filenames can be found here.] 

==How do I create a storyboard to my beatmap?==
Click the &quot;Design&quot; tab to open up the SBE ([[Storyboard Editor]]).

=Keyboard Shortcuts=

=What is &quot;Beatmapping&quot;?=
'''Beatmapping''' is the process of creating beatmaps in osu! for players to play.
It involves choosing a song, [[timing]], placement of objects, and (optionally) [[skinning]] and [[Storyboarding|storyboarding]].

To start, press the '''Edit''' button.

Mappers usually want to get their beatmaps [[Ranked beatmap|ranked]], which consists of a [[beatmap approval]] process, where when completed successfully, a scoreboard will be assigned onto the beatmap and is considered complete unless the mapper wish to add/change something to it.

The most common difficulties created in Beatmapping are:
* [[Easy]]
* [[Normal]]
* [[Hard]]
* [[Insane]]
Clicking each link will display a common set of guidelines [[Mappers|mappers]] follow to be able to create an entertaining beatmap appropriate for its [[Difficulty|difficulty]] level.

It is also not uncommon for [[Mappers|mappers]] to use custom [[Difficulty|difficulty]] names in place of these. (Like &quot;Mario&quot; for example)

Additionally you may find [[Guest Difficulty|Guest Difficulties]] which are commonly labeled as mapper's difficulty (For example Larto's Insane).

With the addition of the Special modes, you can now add mod-specific difficulties to your beatmap other than the usual osu! difficulty. It is entirely possible to fill the beatmap with only Taiko/Catch the Beat/Osu!mania difficulties provided there is an Easy/Normal difficulty in it.

=Getting Started=
==How do I start a new beatmap?==
As osu! is a rhythm based game, the songs you choose to map should have an obvious and constant beat. Try to avoid songs which have tempo (speed) changes or slow songs until you are more experienced and used to the beatmapping mechanism. 

To start a new beatmap, follow these simple steps:-
*Drag and drop the audio file onto osu! (Opened or not is not an issue here) 
:Alternative route: Put audio file onto the &quot;Songs&quot; folder.
:*It should open and direct you to the edit screen with your audio file at there. 
:*Your new song will be at the bottom of the song list, highlighted in purple.
*Click on the song to open up Song Setup. 
**Insert and check that the song title and artist are correct, and add Source and Tags if necessary, then enter in an appropriate difficulty name (Easy, Insane and Cruisin' are examples, you can change it later anyway).
*You can set the other options now if you want, but they can be changed later on. Click OK, and you can start beatmapping! The next step is to add timing to your beatmap.

==How do I time a song properly?==
{{Main|Timing}}
'''Timing is vital - incorrectly timed maps will not be considered for ranking.''' Make sure your timing is perfect before putting any notes in. If in doubt about timing, contact a mod for help first, or submit your song into the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10 Beatmap Help forum]. This will save a ''lot'' of hassle later on. 

Here are some tips for getting your timing right:-
*Watch the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/39317 video] [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/3815/ tutorials] for basic timing methods.
*Make sure the ticks of the metronome coincide with the beat of the song for the entire length of the song. So check the timing at 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the song, at the very least.
*Take a look at the BPM gauge. If the number is very close to a whole number (until .10 difference), it is probably better (unless requested not) to round down to that whole number. If so, manually enter in the correct BPM using the Timing Setup Panel.
**Example: 150.02 should be rounded down to 150.00 unless requested by another mapper that it doesn't sound correct with reason.
*For fine-tuning of the offset, slow the song down to 0.5x (or even 0.25x if necessary) and adjust the values until the beats exactly coincide with the metronome ticks.
*Some songs have multiple BPMs. You can cater for this by adding a timing section (Timing --&gt; Add Timing Section) where the timing changes. The BPM and offset for the new timing section can be found exactly as before. The Timing Setup Panel gives a list of all timing sections in the song.

==What information do I enter in Song Setup?==
{{Main|Song Setup#Song and Map Meta Data}}

You should enter this information before you create a second difficulty, to ensure that the description will be consistent across all of the maps in the set. You  are currently '''allowed to use Unicode characters.'''

[https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/249288 Guide on finding Metadata].

!Name

|-
|'''Artist'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The band, singer, or group that performed or created the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' osu! will pull the artist from the mp3 file, but please double check it to make sure it is spelled and punctuated correctly. '''Anime/Game titles or companies do not belong here (they belong to Tags).''' You can usually find the composer for anime and game songs on Wikipedia or other reliable sources such as [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ AnimeNewsNetwork] or [http://myanimelist.net/ MyAnimeList]. Foreign names should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency).
|-
|'''Romanised Artist''' 
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the artist of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency). This field will become active if you use Unicode characters in the ''Artist'' field.
|-
|'''Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It will be pulled automatically from the mp3 file, but double check for spelling or capitalization errors, especially if you get the mp3 online. Use only the official title of the song. 
|-
|'''Romanised Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' Again, this field will become active if you use Unicode characters in the ''Title'' field.
|-
|'''Beatmap Creator'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;That's you. osu! should handle this automatically, so you shouldn't edit this.&lt;/u&gt;''' If you are including a guest difficulty made by someone else, their name belongs in the Difficulty field below, not here.
|-
|'''Difficulty'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the difficulty of map.&lt;/u&gt;''' The dropdown contains the preset names: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane. You can select one of the default names, or create your own name. While it's good to be creative, try to make it very clear which one is harder than others as ambiguous difficulty names can annoy players. This would also be the field where you indicate a guest mapper, if this is their difficulty (e.g. &quot;Larto's Hard&quot;).
|-
|'''Source'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Where this song originate from.&lt;/u&gt;''' This field should generally only be included for Anime or Video Game songs, and occasionally for Novelty (Movies, TV, or Internet) songs. If the song is from an anime or video game, or is famous for its use as a TV or movie theme, the title of that source goes here.&lt;br&gt; Rock and Pop songs should generally leave the field blank. '''This is not to be used for things like album titles.'''
|-
|'''Tags'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Keywords to help in searches.&lt;/u&gt;''' Common uses include album names, guest difficulty creators, company name and other terms that may be used by people when searching for specific wants (like eroge or visual novel for example if your beatmap's song is based on an eroge visual novel). If your map has &quot;collab&quot; elements mapped by other mappers, their names can go here. Tags are separated by spaces. It is not compulsory to fill in but is greatly appreciated when using the Web search and osu! search in-game. &lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' If you have a tag of &quot;qwertyuiop&quot; as a tag on your beatmap, you can also find your beatmap in-game by typing in &quot;qwertyuiop&quot;.

Again, to avoid issues, please make sure that everything (aside from Difficulty name) is filled out identically for each difficulty.

=Fundamentals of Beatmapping=
==Bookmark==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot;
|-
! align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; scope=&quot;col&quot; | Bookmarking command
|-
|Ctrl + B||'''Add''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Shift + B||'''Remove''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Right Arrow||'''Next''' bookmark.
|-
|Ctrl + Left Arrow||'''Previous''' bookmark. 
|}

'''&lt;u&gt;Bookmark is a tool that marks the timeline.&lt;/u&gt;''' This is useful for planning out the specific places where you may want to place a BPM switch point or reserving space to place a complex design later. Depending on your preference, you may abuse this as you play the song while using the command based on the beat as a rough guide on how the beatmap would be.

==Adding normal hit circles==
This should be a straightforward and intuitive process. Below are some useful tips for Normal-type hit objects:-
*The grid level can be changed for more precision by going to View --&gt; Grid Level. Notes will automatically snap to the grid.
**You can override grid snapping and time snapping by holding Shift while performing a move/placement action.
*Right-clicking on a note or a selected group of notes will delete them. Right-clicking elsewhere will toggle a new combo.
*Common Windows shortcuts also apply in the osu! editor (e.g. Ctrl+A selects all notes, Ctrl+C/V is copy/paste, Ctrl+Z is undo).
*Notes will snap to visible sliders - so if you want to place a circle exactly on the end of a slider, place it while you can still see the slider and then move it forward/backward in the timeline if necessary. 

==Adding Sliders==
Before delving into sliders, do the following two things:

*Make sure you set the Slider Velocity (under the Timing tab) to your preferred value. This value will apply for the entire beatmap, so choose carefully! Changing Slider Velocity after placing sliders will result in wonky, mistimed sliders - try and avoid this eventuality!
*Set the type of slider you want. There are two types of curves - Bezier and Linear.
**Bezier is recommended as it produces the smoothest looking curves. 
**Linear mode is useful if you want sharp (e.g. 90 degree) corners in your sliders. 

Now you can begin adding a slider. Left-click to start the slider, add waypoints with further left-clicks, and terminate with a right-click to make a bezier slider. If you want to create a liner slider, make a bezier-shaped slider first, then left-clicking on an existing vertex will turn that vertex red and create a new anchor point to allow for sharp turns and new curves. It is recommended to make sure the length of the slider is correct before adjusting the shape. 

Here are some other tips regarding sliders:-
*To add repeats on a slider, drag the end of the slider in the timeline after finishing placement.
*Drag an individual waypoint to move it. Right-clicking removes a point, and Ctrl+clicking adds a point.
*In the same way as hit circles, you can override any snapping by holding shift. This can be useful for aligning sliders perfectly. 

Try and put some effort into making your sliders look nice! Lopsided/overlapped/wonky/plain-ugly sliders really ruin the look of a beatmap! Additionally, ensure that your sliders do not overlap one another, the tail end of your slider is always visible, and that the slider path is not obscured in any way - such as unpredictable U-turns or making the head and tail of the slider overlap. These slider-crafting pitfalls should be avoided!

==Adding Spinners==
To add a spinner to your map, left-click to begin it, then scroll the timeline to where you want the end to be, and terminate with a right-click. Try and keep your spinners to a reasonable length - overly long spinners are tiring and boring, whilst spinners that are too short are not nice. ^&quot;Spinner spam&quot; (as in, more than 5 spinner in one time) is a definite no-no! 

^&quot;Spinner Spam&quot; note: This is because [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/296 Trans-Siberian Orchestra - Wizards In Winter (Impossible difficulty)] have roughly 48~51 count in ~5 seconds. The beatmap itself contains lengthy streams of hit-circles and perfectly rankable if excluding the ninja spinner spam.

==What are Combos?==
Combos are groups of notes, essential to the scoring in osu!. Different combos have different colours. It is important that you use combos in your beatmaps to ensure better perception and understanding of the song stanza. Typically, combos should be based on the sound (drumming, guitar-streaming, singing) of the music in some way so pay attention to the stanzas displayed in the timing panel if you need some guidance. As a rough guide, a good length of a combo should be around 5-15 excluding streaming (10-30). 

Note: End combos (Geki and Katu specifically) will increase the HP bar by a good amount compared to typical 300. Short combos are preferred since longer combos yield less health in comparison and may cause the beatmap to become unnaturally hard due to HP drain.

==How do I add Breaks into my beatmap?==
To give players a bit of rest time during a longer beatmap, you should include a Break. To do this, simply leave a gap in the beatmap where you want the break to be, and click the &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; button in the editor. Note that you must insert a break between two hit objects, so place notes at the start and end to &quot;mark out&quot; the break before inserting one! 

A couple of rules of thumb are:-
*Generally, try to keep play segments below one minute long. A two minute song should have at least one break in it near the middle, a three minute song should have at least two breaks evenly spaced. This may change depending on the song used. 
*Keep break lengths reasonable. Breaks of less than 1 second are pretty pointless ([http://osu.ppy.sh/b/19842 unless you try to imitate the video game style by summoning warning-arrow]), and breaks of 30 seconds are hardly used and not practical. Try and aim for 5-15 second breaks. 

Here are some advanced tips on planning breaks through the use of Bookmarks:-
*Before you start the map, play through the song and decide where you want the breaks - try include one at regular intervals.
*Use bookmarks to mark out the start and end of each break on the timeline!
*Put in a temporary &quot;marker&quot; (a Normal hitcircle will do) at each bookmark, then click &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; whilst you are in between to add the break.

*An example is shown below:-
[[File:Osu-breaks.png]]
*Note how the breaks are evenly spaced throughout the song and are not too short/long, ensuring the player gets adequate recuperation from their intense clicking marathon, without falling asleep in the meantime! Breaks are displayed as the white brackets on the timeline at the bottom of the editor window.
*Notice the bookmark at the start of the song also, to mark the first note. Bookmarks are useful! Use them to your advantage.

==What is Beat Spacing?==
[[File:Beatspacing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A quick illustration]]
For intuitive play, your beatmaps should have good &quot;beat spacing&quot;! In general, beats that are close together on the timeline should be close together on the beatmap, and vice versa. This is to ensure the flow of the song sync with the beatmap design harmonically, making the beatmap much more enjoyable.

The simplest way to ensure beat spacing is correct on your beatmaps is to utilize the editor's [[Distance Snap]]ping function, found in the upper-right hand side of the editor. The relative distance between notes can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. If you stick to using Distance Snap for the whole song, correct beat spacing is guaranteed!

==How do I add more difficulty levels for a song?==
To make a new difficulty level, simply open your existing difficulty, choose &quot;File&quot; --&gt; &quot;Save As New Difficulty...&quot; and change the entry in the Difficulty box. 

Be sure to add variation between different difficulty levels. Add, take away or rearrange notes to make new patterns. Flip or rotate existing notes. The beatmap difficulties should feel familiar to some degree (like the speed of BPM, BPM change points or certain beatmap design) while ^retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty. 

'''Note:''' Changing the difficulty settings (e.g. HP drain rate) is not considered a new beatmap difficulty. This is called plain laziness, and will likely be requested to create a new beatmap design.

^&quot;retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty&quot;: Difference in beatmap design (as in, no exact repeated flipped design from Easy for Normal). 

==Why do combo numberings change as I play through the song?==
If you have a circle on your mouse cursor (i.e. you are in placement mode) it will act as if you have placed it - changing the combo numbers/colours for any circles that occur after it.

=Visualisation of beatmap=
==How do I change the background colour?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Set BG Colour&quot; which allows you to choose your own background colour. Theoretically speaking, it is most likely to be replaced by background image/video unless you are planning to use a storyboard.

==How do I add a background image or video?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Insert Background&quot;. When clicked, a dialog box will appear, allowing you to browse around your computer for the image or video you want to be added. The image/video will automatically be copied into the song folder, and will be included when submitting your beatmap. 

Some notes:-
*Images can be in .JPG or .PNG format. It is best if you keep them under 800x600 in size. (To save file size)
** Try to compress your images if possible. There are a couple of programs on the internet that can help you.
*Videos should be encoded using DiVX, xvid or similar codecs. Using codecs like H.264 is not recommended.
**Remove the audio of the video to decrease the file size.
*Images and videos can be removed by deleting them from the song folder. 

==How do I add custom images and sounds to my beatmap?==
*Create your desired image/sound file.
*Save it with an appropriate name. 
**Random name: For storyboard. Does exactly nothing when not implemented onto the beatmap.
***Example: A, Lyric1, 007, etc. (As long as you know which one is which one)
**Skin name: The beatmap will use the file automatically, replacing one of the player's skin element. You will notice this. 
***Example: normal-hitnormal (This sound file will be played instead of player skin's sound file)
*Drop it into your song's folder. 

[http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/729/start=0 A list of appropriate custom sound filenames can be found here.] 

==How do I create a storyboard to my beatmap?==
Click the &quot;Design&quot; tab to open up the SBE ([[Storyboard Editor]]).

=What is &quot;Beatmapping&quot;?=
'''Beatmapping''' is the process of creating beatmaps in osu! for players to play.
It involves choosing a song, [[timing]], placement of objects, and (optionally) [[skinning]] and [[Storyboarding|storyboarding]].

To start, press the '''Edit''' button.

Mappers usually want to get their beatmaps [[Ranked beatmap|ranked]], which consists of a [[beatmap approval]] process, where when completed successfully, a scoreboard will be assigned onto the beatmap and is considered complete unless the mapper wish to add/change something to it.

The most common difficulties created in Beatmapping are:
* [[Easy]]
* [[Normal]]
* [[Hard]]
* [[Insane]]
Clicking each link will display a common set of guidelines [[Mappers|mappers]] follow to be able to create an entertaining beatmap appropriate for its [[Difficulty|difficulty]] level.

It is also not uncommon for [[Mappers|mappers]] to use custom [[Difficulty|difficulty]] names in place of these. (Like &quot;Mario&quot; for example)

Additionally you may find [[Guest Difficulty|Guest Difficulties]] which are commonly labeled as mapper's difficulty (For example Larto's Insane).

With the addition of the Special modes, you can now add mod-specific difficulties to your beatmap other than the usual osu! difficulty. It is entirely possible to fill the beatmap with only Taiko/Catch the Beat/Osu!mania difficulties provided there is an Easy/Normal difficulty in it.

=Getting Started=
==How do I start a new beatmap?==
As osu! is a rhythm based game, the songs you choose to map should have an obvious and constant beat. Try to avoid songs which have tempo (speed) changes or slow songs until you are more experienced and used to the beatmapping mechanism. 

To start a new beatmap, follow these simple steps:-
*Drag and drop the audio file onto osu! (Opened or not is not an issue here) 
:Alternative route: Put audio file onto the &quot;Songs&quot; folder.
:*It should open and direct you to the edit screen with your audio file at there. 
:*Your new song will be at the bottom of the song list, highlighted in purple.
*Click on the song to open up Song Setup. 
**Insert and check that the song title and artist are correct, and add Source and Tags if necessary, then enter in an appropriate difficulty name (Easy, Insane and Cruisin' are examples, you can change it later anyway).
*You can set the other options now if you want, but they can be changed later on. Click OK, and you can start beatmapping! The next step is to add timing to your beatmap.

==How do I time a song properly?==
{{Main|Timing}}
'''Timing is vital - incorrectly timed maps will not be considered for ranking.''' Make sure your timing is perfect before putting any notes in. If in doubt about timing, contact a mod for help first, or submit your song into the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10 Beatmap Help forum]. This will save a ''lot'' of hassle later on. 

Here are some tips for getting your timing right:-
*Watch the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/39317 video] [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/3815/ tutorials] for basic timing methods.
*Make sure the ticks of the metronome coincide with the beat of the song for the entire length of the song. So check the timing at 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the song, at the very least.
*Take a look at the BPM gauge. If the number is very close to a whole number (until .10 difference), it is probably better (unless requested not) to round down to that whole number. If so, manually enter in the correct BPM using the Timing Setup Panel.
**Example: 150.02 should be rounded down to 150.00 unless requested by another mapper that it doesn't sound correct with reason.
*For fine-tuning of the offset, slow the song down to 0.5x (or even 0.25x if necessary) and adjust the values until the beats exactly coincide with the metronome ticks.
*Some songs have multiple BPMs. You can cater for this by adding a timing section (Timing --&gt; Add Timing Section) where the timing changes. The BPM and offset for the new timing section can be found exactly as before. The Timing Setup Panel gives a list of all timing sections in the song.

==What information do I enter in Song Setup?==
{{Main|Song Setup#Song and Map Meta Data}}

You should enter this information before you create a second difficulty, to ensure that the description will be consistent across all of the maps in the set. You  are currently '''allowed to use Unicode characters.'''

|'''Artist'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The band, singer, or group that performed or created the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' osu! will pull the artist from the mp3 file, but please double check it to make sure it is spelled and punctuated correctly. '''Anime/Game titles or companies do not belong here (they belong to Tags).''' You can usually find the composer for anime and game songs on Wikipedia or other reliable sources such as [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ AnimeNewsNetwork] or [http://myanimelist.net/ MyAnimeList]. Foreign names should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency).
|-
|'''Romanised Artist''' 
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the artist of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency). This field will become active if you use Unicode characters in the ''Artist'' field.
|-
|'''Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It will be pulled automatically from the mp3 file, but double check for spelling or capitalization errors, especially if you get the mp3 online. Use only the official title of the song. 
|-
|'''Romanised Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' Again, this field will become active if you use Unicode characters in the ''Title'' field.
|-
|'''Beatmap Creator'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;That's you. osu! should handle this automatically, so you shouldn't edit this.&lt;/u&gt;''' If you are including a guest difficulty made by someone else, their name belongs in the Difficulty field below, not here.
|-
|'''Difficulty'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the difficulty of map.&lt;/u&gt;''' The dropdown contains the preset names: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane. You can select one of the default names, or create your own name. While it's good to be creative, try to make it very clear which one is harder than others as ambiguous difficulty names can annoy players. This would also be the field where you indicate a guest mapper, if this is their difficulty (e.g. &quot;Larto's Hard&quot;).
|-
|'''Source'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Where this song originate from.&lt;/u&gt;''' This field should generally only be included for Anime or Video Game songs, and occasionally for Novelty (Movies, TV, or Internet) songs. If the song is from an anime or video game, or is famous for its use as a TV or movie theme, the title of that source goes here.&lt;br&gt; Rock and Pop songs should generally leave the field blank. '''This is not to be used for things like album titles.'''
|-
|'''Tags'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Keywords to help in searches.&lt;/u&gt;''' Common uses include album names, guest difficulty creators, company name and other terms that may be used by people when searching for specific wants (like eroge or visual novel for example if your beatmap's song is based on an eroge visual novel). If your map has &quot;collab&quot; elements mapped by other mappers, their names can go here. Tags are separated by spaces. It is not compulsory to fill in but is greatly appreciated when using the Web search and osu! search in-game. &lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' If you have a tag of &quot;qwertyuiop&quot; as a tag on your beatmap, you can also find your beatmap in-game by typing in &quot;qwertyuiop&quot;.

=Fundamentals of Beatmapping=
==Bookmark==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot;
|-
! align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; scope=&quot;col&quot; | Bookmarking command
|-
|Ctrl + B||'''Add''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Shift + B||'''Remove''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Right Arrow||'''Next''' bookmark.
|-
|Ctrl + Left Arrow||'''Previous''' bookmark. 
|}

'''&lt;u&gt;Bookmark is a tool that marks the timeline.&lt;/u&gt;''' This is useful for planning out the specific places where you may want to place a BPM switch point or reserving space to place a complex design later. Depending on your preference, you may abuse this as you play the song while using the command based on the beat as a rough guide on how the beatmap would be.

==Adding normal hit circles==
This should be a straightforward and intuitive process. Below are some useful tips for Normal-type hit objects:-
*The grid level can be changed for more precision by going to View --&gt; Grid Level. Notes will automatically snap to the grid.
**You can override grid snapping and time snapping by holding Shift while performing a move/placement action.
*Right-clicking on a note or a selected group of notes will delete them. Right-clicking elsewhere will toggle a new combo.
*Common Windows shortcuts also apply in the osu! editor (e.g. Ctrl+A selects all notes, Ctrl+C/V is copy/paste, Ctrl+Z is undo).
*Notes will snap to visible sliders - so if you want to place a circle exactly on the end of a slider, place it while you can still see the slider and then move it forward/backward in the timeline if necessary. 

==Adding Sliders==
Before delving into sliders, do the following two things:

*Make sure you set the Slider Velocity (under the Timing tab) to your preferred value. This value will apply for the entire beatmap, so choose carefully! Changing Slider Velocity after placing sliders will result in wonky, mistimed sliders - try and avoid this eventuality!
*Set the type of slider you want. There are two types of curves - Bezier and Linear.
**Bezier is recommended as it produces the smoothest looking curves. 
**Linear mode is useful if you want sharp (e.g. 90 degree) corners in your sliders. 

Now you can begin adding a slider. Left-click to start the slider, add waypoints with further left-clicks, and terminate with a right-click to make a bezier slider. If you want to create a liner slider, make a bezier-shaped slider first, then left-clicking on an existing vertex will turn that vertex red and create a new anchor point to allow for sharp turns and new curves. It is recommended to make sure the length of the slider is correct before adjusting the shape. 

Here are some other tips regarding sliders:-
*To add repeats on a slider, drag the end of the slider in the timeline after finishing placement.
*Drag an individual waypoint to move it. Right-clicking removes a point, and Ctrl+clicking adds a point.
*In the same way as hit circles, you can override any snapping by holding shift. This can be useful for aligning sliders perfectly. 

Try and put some effort into making your sliders look nice! Lopsided/overlapped/wonky/plain-ugly sliders really ruin the look of a beatmap! Additionally, ensure that your sliders do not overlap one another, the tail end of your slider is always visible, and that the slider path is not obscured in any way - such as unpredictable U-turns or making the head and tail of the slider overlap. These slider-crafting pitfalls should be avoided!

==Adding Spinners==
To add a spinner to your map, left-click to begin it, then scroll the timeline to where you want the end to be, and terminate with a right-click. Try and keep your spinners to a reasonable length - overly long spinners are tiring and boring, whilst spinners that are too short are not nice. ^&quot;Spinner spam&quot; (as in, more than 5 spinner in one time) is a definite no-no! 

^&quot;Spinner Spam&quot; note: This is because [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/296 Trans-Siberian Orchestra - Wizards In Winter (Impossible difficulty)] have roughly 48~51 count in ~5 seconds. The beatmap itself contains lengthy streams of hit-circles and perfectly rankable if excluding the ninja spinner spam.

==What are Combos?==
Combos are groups of notes, essential to the scoring in osu!. Different combos have different colours. It is important that you use combos in your beatmaps to ensure better perception and understanding of the song stanza. Typically, combos should be based on the sound (drumming, guitar-streaming, singing) of the music in some way so pay attention to the stanzas displayed in the timing panel if you need some guidance. As a rough guide, a good length of a combo should be around 5-15 excluding streaming (10-30). 

Note: End combos (Geki and Katu specifically) will increase the HP bar by a good amount compared to typical 300. Short combos are preferred since longer combos yield less health in comparison and may cause the beatmap to become unnaturally hard due to HP drain.

==How do I add Breaks into my beatmap?==
To give players a bit of rest time during a longer beatmap, you should include a Break. To do this, simply leave a gap in the beatmap where you want the break to be, and click the &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; button in the editor. Note that you must insert a break between two hit objects, so place notes at the start and end to &quot;mark out&quot; the break before inserting one! 

A couple of rules of thumb are:-
*Generally, try to keep play segments below one minute long. A two minute song should have at least one break in it near the middle, a three minute song should have at least two breaks evenly spaced. This may change depending on the song used. 
*Keep break lengths reasonable. Breaks of less than 1 second are pretty pointless ([http://osu.ppy.sh/b/19842 unless you try to imitate the video game style by summoning warning-arrow]), and breaks of 30 seconds are hardly used and not practical. Try and aim for 5-15 second breaks. 

Here are some advanced tips on planning breaks through the use of Bookmarks:-
*Before you start the map, play through the song and decide where you want the breaks - try include one at regular intervals.
*Use bookmarks to mark out the start and end of each break on the timeline!
*Put in a temporary &quot;marker&quot; (a Normal hitcircle will do) at each bookmark, then click &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; whilst you are in between to add the break.

*An example is shown below:-
[[File:Osu-breaks.png]]
*Note how the breaks are evenly spaced throughout the song and are not too short/long, ensuring the player gets adequate recuperation from their intense clicking marathon, without falling asleep in the meantime! Breaks are displayed as the white brackets on the timeline at the bottom of the editor window.
*Notice the bookmark at the start of the song also, to mark the first note. Bookmarks are useful! Use them to your advantage.

==What is Beat Spacing?==
[[File:Beatspacing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A quick illustration]]
For intuitive play, your beatmaps should have good &quot;beat spacing&quot;! In general, beats that are close together on the timeline should be close together on the beatmap, and vice versa. This is to ensure the flow of the song sync with the beatmap design harmonically, making the beatmap much more enjoyable.

The simplest way to ensure beat spacing is correct on your beatmaps is to utilize the editor's [[Distance Snap]]ping function, found in the upper-right hand side of the editor. The relative distance between notes can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. If you stick to using Distance Snap for the whole song, correct beat spacing is guaranteed!

==How do I add more difficulty levels for a song?==
To make a new difficulty level, simply open your existing difficulty, choose &quot;File&quot; --&gt; &quot;Save As New Difficulty...&quot; and change the entry in the Difficulty box. 

Be sure to add variation between different difficulty levels. Add, take away or rearrange notes to make new patterns. Flip or rotate existing notes. The beatmap difficulties should feel familiar to some degree (like the speed of BPM, BPM change points or certain beatmap design) while ^retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty. 

'''Note:''' Changing the difficulty settings (e.g. HP drain rate) is not considered a new beatmap difficulty. This is called plain laziness, and will likely be requested to create a new beatmap design.

^&quot;retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty&quot;: Difference in beatmap design (as in, no exact repeated flipped design from Easy for Normal). 

==Why do combo numberings change as I play through the song?==
If you have a circle on your mouse cursor (i.e. you are in placement mode) it will act as if you have placed it - changing the combo numbers/colours for any circles that occur after it.

=Visualisation of beatmap=
==How do I change the background colour?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Set BG Colour&quot; which allows you to choose your own background colour. Theoretically speaking, it is most likely to be replaced by background image/video unless you are planning to use a storyboard.

==How do I add a background image or video?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Insert Background&quot;. When clicked, a dialog box will appear, allowing you to browse around your computer for the image or video you want to be added. The image/video will automatically be copied into the song folder, and will be included when submitting your beatmap. 

Some notes:-
*Images can be in .JPG or .PNG format. It is best if you keep them under 800x600 in size. (To save file size)
** Try to compress your images if possible. There are a couple of programs on the internet that can help you.
*Videos should be encoded using DiVX, xvid or similar codecs. Using codecs like H.264 is not recommended.
**Remove the audio of the video to decrease the file size.
*Images and videos can be removed by deleting them from the song folder. 

==How do I add custom images and sounds to my beatmap?==
*Create your desired image/sound file.
*Save it with an appropriate name. 
**Random name: For storyboard. Does exactly nothing when not implemented onto the beatmap.
***Example: A, Lyric1, 007, etc. (As long as you know which one is which one)
**Skin name: The beatmap will use the file automatically, replacing one of the player's skin element. You will notice this. 
***Example: normal-hitnormal (This sound file will be played instead of player skin's sound file)
*Drop it into your song's folder. 

[http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/729/start=0 A list of appropriate custom sound filenames can be found here.] 

==How do I create a storyboard to my beatmap?==
Click the &quot;Design&quot; tab to open up the SBE ([[Storyboard Editor]]).

=What is &quot;Beatmapping&quot;?=
'''Beatmapping''' is the process of creating beatmaps in osu! for players to play.
It involves choosing a song, [[IT:Timing|timing]], placement of objects, and (optionally) [[IT:Skinning|skinning]] and [[IT:Storyboarding|storyboarding]].

To start, press the '''Edit''' button.

Mappers usually want to get their beatmaps [[IT:Ranked beatmap|ranked]], which consists of a [[IT:Beatmap approval|beatmap approval]] process, where when completed successfully, a scoreboard will be assigned onto the beatmap and is considered complete unless the mapper wish to add/change something to it.

The most common difficulties created in Beatmapping are:
* [[IT:Easy|Easy]]
* [[IT:Normal|Normal]]
* [[IT:Hard|Hard]]
* [[IT:Insane|Insane]]
Clicking each link will display a common set of guidelines [[IT:Mappers|mappers]] follow to be able to create an entertaining beatmap appropriate for its [[IT:Difficulty|difficulty]] level.

It is also not uncommon for [[IT:Mappers|mappers]] to use custom [[IT:Difficulty|difficulty]] names in place of these. (Like &quot;Mario&quot; for example)

Additionally you may find [[IT:Guest Difficulty|Guest Difficulties]] which are commonly labeled as mapper's difficulty (For example Larto's Insane).

With the addition of the Special modes, you can now add mod-specific difficulties to your beatmap other than the usual osu! difficulty. It is entirely possible to fill the beatmap with only Taiko/Catch the Beat/Osu!mania difficulties provided there is an Easy/Normal difficulty in it.

=Getting Started=
==How do I start a new beatmap?==
As osu! is a rhythm based game, the songs you choose to map should have an obvious and constant beat. Try to avoid songs which have tempo (speed) changes or slow songs until you are more experienced and used to the beatmapping mechanism. 

To start a new beatmap, follow these simple steps:-
*Drag and drop the audio file onto osu! (Opened or not is not an issue here) 
:Alternative route: Put audio file onto the &quot;Songs&quot; folder.
:*It should open and direct you to the edit screen with your audio file at there. 
:*Your new song will be at the bottom of the song list, highlighted in purple.
*Click on the song to open up Song Setup. 
**Insert and check that the song title and artist are correct, and add Source and Tags if necessary, then enter in an appropriate difficulty name (Easy, Insane and Cruisin' are examples, you can change it later anyway).
*You can set the other options now if you want, but they can be changed later on. Click OK, and you can start beatmapping! The next step is to add timing to your beatmap.

==How do I time a song properly?==
{{Main|Timing}}
'''Timing is vital - incorrectly timed maps will not be considered for ranking.''' Make sure your timing is perfect before putting any notes in. If in doubt about timing, contact a mod for help first, or submit your song into the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10 Beatmap Help forum]. This will save a ''lot'' of hassle later on. 

Here are some tips for getting your timing right:-
*Watch the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/39317 video] [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/3815/ tutorials] for basic timing methods.
*Make sure the ticks of the metronome coincide with the beat of the song for the entire length of the song. So check the timing at 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the song, at the very least.
*Take a look at the BPM gauge. If the number is very close to a whole number (until .10 difference), it is probably better (unless requested not) to round down to that whole number. If so, manually enter in the correct BPM using the Timing Setup Panel.
**Example: 150.02 should be rounded down to 150.00 unless requested by another mapper that it doesn't sound correct with reason.
*For fine-tuning of the offset, slow the song down to 0.5x (or even 0.25x if necessary) and adjust the values until the beats exactly coincide with the metronome ticks.
*Some songs have multiple BPMs. You can cater for this by adding a timing section (Timing --&gt; Add Timing Section) where the timing changes. The BPM and offset for the new timing section can be found exactly as before. The Timing Setup Panel gives a list of all timing sections in the song.

==What information do I enter in Song Setup?==
{{Main|Song Setup#Song and Map Meta Data}}

You should enter this information before you create a second difficulty, to ensure that the description will be consistent across all of the maps in the set. You  are currently '''allowed to use Unicode characters.'''

|'''Artist'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The band, singer, or group that performed or created the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' osu! will pull the artist from the mp3 file, but please double check it to make sure it is spelled and punctuated correctly. '''Anime/Game titles or companies do not belong here (they belong to Tags).''' You can usually find the composer for anime and game songs on Wikipedia or other reliable sources such as [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ AnimeNewsNetwork] or [http://myanimelist.net/ MyAnimeList]. Foreign names should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency).
|-
|'''Romanised Artist''' 
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the artist of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency). This field will become active if you use Unicode characters in the ''Artist'' field.
|-
|'''Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It will be pulled automatically from the mp3 file, but double check for spelling or capitalization errors, especially if you get the mp3 online. Use only the official title of the song. 
|-
|'''Romanised Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' Again, this field will become active if you use Unicode characters in the ''Title'' field.
|-
|'''Beatmap Creator'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;That's you. osu! should handle this automatically, so you shouldn't edit this.&lt;/u&gt;''' If you are including a guest difficulty made by someone else, their name belongs in the Difficulty field below, not here.
|-
|'''Difficulty'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the difficulty of map.&lt;/u&gt;''' The dropdown contains the preset names: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane. You can select one of the default names, or create your own name. While it's good to be creative, try to make it very clear which one is harder than others as ambiguous difficulty names can annoy players. This would also be the field where you indicate a guest mapper, if this is their difficulty (e.g. &quot;Larto's Hard&quot;).
|-
|'''Source'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Where this song originate from.&lt;/u&gt;''' This field should generally only be included for Anime or Video Game songs, and occasionally for Novelty (Movies, TV, or Internet) songs. If the song is from an anime or video game, or is famous for its use as a TV or movie theme, the title of that source goes here.&lt;br&gt; Rock and Pop songs should generally leave the field blank. '''This is not to be used for things like album titles.'''
|-
|'''Tags'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Keywords to help in searches.&lt;/u&gt;''' Common uses include album names, guest difficulty creators, company name and other terms that may be used by people when searching for specific wants (like eroge or visual novel for example if your beatmap's song is based on an eroge visual novel). If your map has &quot;collab&quot; elements mapped by other mappers, their names can go here. Tags are separated by spaces. It is not compulsory to fill in but is greatly appreciated when using the Web search and osu! search in-game. &lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' If you have a tag of &quot;qwertyuiop&quot; as a tag on your beatmap, you can also find your beatmap in-game by typing in &quot;qwertyuiop&quot;.

Again, to avoid issues, please make sure that everything (aside from Difficulty name) is filled out identically for each difficulty.

=Fundamentals of Beatmapping=
==Bookmark==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot;
|-
! align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; scope=&quot;col&quot; | Bookmarking command
|-
|Ctrl + B||'''Add''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Shift + B||'''Remove''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Right Arrow||'''Next''' bookmark.
|-
|Ctrl + Left Arrow||'''Previous''' bookmark. 
|}

'''&lt;u&gt;Bookmark is a tool that marks the timeline.&lt;/u&gt;''' This is useful for planning out the specific places where you may want to place a BPM switch point or reserving space to place a complex design later. Depending on your preference, you may abuse this as you play the song while using the command based on the beat as a rough guide on how the beatmap would be.

==Adding normal hit circles==
This should be a straightforward and intuitive process. Below are some useful tips for Normal-type hit objects:-
*The grid level can be changed for more precision by going to View --&gt; Grid Level. Notes will automatically snap to the grid.
**You can override grid snapping and time snapping by holding Shift while performing a move/placement action.
*Right-clicking on a note or a selected group of notes will delete them. Right-clicking elsewhere will toggle a new combo.
*Common Windows shortcuts also apply in the osu! editor (e.g. Ctrl+A selects all notes, Ctrl+C/V is copy/paste, Ctrl+Z is undo).
*Notes will snap to visible sliders - so if you want to place a circle exactly on the end of a slider, place it while you can still see the slider and then move it forward/backward in the timeline if necessary. 

==Adding Sliders==
Before delving into sliders, do the following two things:

*Make sure you set the Slider Velocity (under the Timing tab) to your preferred value. This value will apply for the entire beatmap, so choose carefully! Changing Slider Velocity after placing sliders will result in wonky, mistimed sliders - try and avoid this eventuality!
*Set the type of slider you want. There are two types of curves - Bezier and Linear.
**Bezier is recommended as it produces the smoothest looking curves. 
**Linear mode is useful if you want sharp (e.g. 90 degree) corners in your sliders. 

Now you can begin adding a slider. Left-click to start the slider, add waypoints with further left-clicks, and terminate with a right-click to make a bezier slider. If you want to create a liner slider, make a bezier-shaped slider first, then left-clicking on an existing vertex will turn that vertex red and create a new anchor point to allow for sharp turns and new curves. It is recommended to make sure the length of the slider is correct before adjusting the shape. 

Here are some other tips regarding sliders:-
*To add repeats on a slider, drag the end of the slider in the timeline after finishing placement.
*Drag an individual waypoint to move it. Right-clicking removes a point, and Ctrl+clicking adds a point.
*In the same way as hit circles, you can override any snapping by holding shift. This can be useful for aligning sliders perfectly. 

Try and put some effort into making your sliders look nice! Lopsided/overlapped/wonky/plain-ugly sliders really ruin the look of a beatmap! Additionally, ensure that your sliders do not overlap one another, the tail end of your slider is always visible, and that the slider path is not obscured in any way - such as unpredictable U-turns or making the head and tail of the slider overlap. These slider-crafting pitfalls should be avoided!

==Adding Spinners==
To add a spinner to your map, left-click to begin it, then scroll the timeline to where you want the end to be, and terminate with a right-click. Try and keep your spinners to a reasonable length - overly long spinners are tiring and boring, whilst spinners that are too short are not nice. ^&quot;Spinner spam&quot; (as in, more than 5 spinner in one time) is a definite no-no! 

^&quot;Spinner Spam&quot; note: This is because [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/296 Trans-Siberian Orchestra - Wizards In Winter (Impossible difficulty)] have roughly 48~51 count in ~5 seconds. The beatmap itself contains lengthy streams of hit-circles and perfectly rankable if excluding the ninja spinner spam.

==What are Combos?==
Combos are groups of notes, essential to the scoring in osu!. Different combos have different colours. It is important that you use combos in your beatmaps to ensure better perception and understanding of the song stanza. Typically, combos should be based on the sound (drumming, guitar-streaming, singing) of the music in some way so pay attention to the stanzas displayed in the timing panel if you need some guidance. As a rough guide, a good length of a combo should be around 5-15 excluding streaming (10-30). 

Note: End combos (Geki and Katu specifically) will increase the HP bar by a good amount compared to typical 300. Short combos are preferred since longer combos yield less health in comparison and may cause the beatmap to become unnaturally hard due to HP drain.

==How do I add Breaks into my beatmap?==
To give players a bit of rest time during a longer beatmap, you should include a Break. To do this, simply leave a gap in the beatmap where you want the break to be, and click the &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; button in the editor. Note that you must insert a break between two hit objects, so place notes at the start and end to &quot;mark out&quot; the break before inserting one! 

A couple of rules of thumb are:-
*Generally, try to keep play segments below one minute long. A two minute song should have at least one break in it near the middle, a three minute song should have at least two breaks evenly spaced. This may change depending on the song used. 
*Keep break lengths reasonable. Breaks of less than 1 second are pretty pointless ([http://osu.ppy.sh/b/19842 unless you try to imitate the video game style by summoning warning-arrow]), and breaks of 30 seconds are hardly used and not practical. Try and aim for 5-15 second breaks. 

Here are some advanced tips on planning breaks through the use of Bookmarks:-
*Before you start the map, play through the song and decide where you want the breaks - try include one at regular intervals.
*Use bookmarks to mark out the start and end of each break on the timeline!
*Put in a temporary &quot;marker&quot; (a Normal hitcircle will do) at each bookmark, then click &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; whilst you are in between to add the break.

*An example is shown below:-
[[File:Osu-breaks.png]]
*Note how the breaks are evenly spaced throughout the song and are not too short/long, ensuring the player gets adequate recuperation from their intense clicking marathon, without falling asleep in the meantime! Breaks are displayed as the white brackets on the timeline at the bottom of the editor window.
*Notice the bookmark at the start of the song also, to mark the first note. Bookmarks are useful! Use them to your advantage.

==What is Beat Spacing?==
[[File:Beatspacing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A quick illustration]]
For intuitive play, your beatmaps should have good &quot;beat spacing&quot;! In general, beats that are close together on the timeline should be close together on the beatmap, and vice versa. This is to ensure the flow of the song sync with the beatmap design harmonically, making the beatmap much more enjoyable.

The simplest way to ensure beat spacing is correct on your beatmaps is to utilize the editor's [[IT:Distance Snap|Distance Snap]]ping function, found in the upper-right hand side of the editor. The relative distance between notes can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. If you stick to using Distance Snap for the whole song, correct beat spacing is guaranteed!

==How do I add more difficulty levels for a song?==
To make a new difficulty level, simply open your existing difficulty, choose &quot;File&quot; --&gt; &quot;Save As New Difficulty...&quot; and change the entry in the Difficulty box. 

Be sure to add variation between different difficulty levels. Add, take away or rearrange notes to make new patterns. Flip or rotate existing notes. The beatmap difficulties should feel familiar to some degree (like the speed of BPM, BPM change points or certain beatmap design) while ^retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty. 

'''Note:''' Changing the difficulty settings (e.g. HP drain rate) is not considered a new beatmap difficulty. This is called plain laziness, and will likely be requested to create a new beatmap design.

^&quot;retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty&quot;: Difference in beatmap design (as in, no exact repeated flipped design from Easy for Normal). 

==Why do combo numberings change as I play through the song?==
If you have a circle on your mouse cursor (i.e. you are in placement mode) it will act as if you have placed it - changing the combo numbers/colours for any circles that occur after it.

=Visualisation of beatmap=
==How do I change the background colour?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Set BG Colour&quot; which allows you to choose your own background colour. Theoretically speaking, it is most likely to be replaced by background image/video unless you are planning to use a storyboard.

==How do I add a background image or video?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Insert Background&quot;. When clicked, a dialog box will appear, allowing you to browse around your computer for the image or video you want to be added. The image/video will automatically be copied into the song folder, and will be included when submitting your beatmap. 

Some notes:-
*Images can be in .JPG or .PNG format. It is best if you keep them under 800x600 in size. (To save file size)
** Try to compress your images if possible. There are a couple of programs on the internet that can help you.
*Videos should be encoded using DiVX, xvid or similar codecs. Using codecs like H.264 is not recommended.
**Remove the audio of the video to decrease the file size.
*Images and videos can be removed by deleting them from the song folder. 

==How do I add custom images and sounds to my beatmap?==
*Create your desired image/sound file.
*Save it with an appropriate name. 
**Random name: For storyboard. Does exactly nothing when not implemented onto the beatmap.
***Example: A, Lyric1, 007, etc. (As long as you know which one is which one)
**Skin name: The beatmap will use the file automatically, replacing one of the player's skin element. You will notice this. 
***Example: normal-hitnormal (This sound file will be played instead of player skin's sound file)
*Drop it into your song's folder. 

[http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/729/start=0 A list of appropriate custom sound filenames can be found here.] 

==How do I create a storyboard to my beatmap?==
Click the &quot;Design&quot; tab to open up the SBE ([[IT:Storyboard Editor|Storyboard Editor]]).

=What is &quot;Beatmapping&quot;?=
'''Beatmapping''' is the process of creating beatmaps in osu! for players to play.
It involves choosing a song, [[IT:Timing|timing]], placement of objects, and (optionally) [[IT:Skinning|skinning]] and [[IT:Storyboarding|storyboarding]].

To start, press the '''Edit''' button.

Mappers usually want to get their beatmaps [[IT:Ranked beatmap|ranked]], which consists of a [[IT:Beatmap approval|beatmap approval]] process, where when completed successfully, a scoreboard will be assigned onto the beatmap and is considered complete unless the mapper wish to add/change something to it.

The most common difficulties created in Beatmapping are:
* [[IT:Easy|Easy]]
* [[IT:Normal|Normal]]
* [[IT:Hard|Hard]]
* [[IT:Insane|Insane]]
Clicking each link will display a common set of guidelines [[IT:Mappers|mappers]] follow to be able to create an entertaining beatmap appropriate for its [[IT:Difficulty|difficulty]] level.

It is also not uncommon for [[IT:Mappers|mappers]] to use custom [[IT:Difficulty|difficulty]] names in place of these. (Like &quot;Mario&quot; for example)

Additionally you may find [[IT:Guest Difficulty|Guest Difficulties]] which are commonly labeled as mapper's difficulty (For example Larto's Insane).

With the addition of the Special modes, you can now add mod-specific difficulties to your beatmap other than the usual osu! difficulty. It is entirely possible to fill the beatmap with only Taiko/Catch the Beat/Osu!mania difficulties provided there is an Easy/Normal difficulty in it.

=Getting Started=
==How do I start a new beatmap?==
As osu! is a rhythm based game, the songs you choose to map should have an obvious and constant beat. Try to avoid songs which have tempo (speed) changes or slow songs until you are more experienced and used to the beatmapping mechanism. 

To start a new beatmap, follow these simple steps:-
*Drag and drop the audio file onto osu! (Opened or not is not an issue here) 
:Alternative route: Put audio file onto the &quot;Songs&quot; folder.
:*It should open and direct you to the edit screen with your audio file at there. 
:*Your new song will be at the bottom of the song list, highlighted in purple.
*Click on the song to open up Song Setup. 
**Insert and check that the song title and artist are correct, and add Source and Tags if necessary, then enter in an appropriate difficulty name (Easy, Insane and Cruisin' are examples, you can change it later anyway).
*You can set the other options now if you want, but they can be changed later on. Click OK, and you can start beatmapping! The next step is to add timing to your beatmap.

==How do I time a song properly?==
{{Main|IT:Timing}}
'''Timing is vital - incorrectly timed maps will not be considered for ranking.''' Make sure your timing is perfect before putting any notes in. If in doubt about timing, contact a mod for help first, or submit your song into the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10 Beatmap Help forum]. This will save a ''lot'' of hassle later on. 

Here are some tips for getting your timing right:-
*Watch the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/39317 video] [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/3815/ tutorials] for basic timing methods.
*Make sure the ticks of the metronome coincide with the beat of the song for the entire length of the song. So check the timing at 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the song, at the very least.
*Take a look at the BPM gauge. If the number is very close to a whole number (until .10 difference), it is probably better (unless requested not) to round down to that whole number. If so, manually enter in the correct BPM using the Timing Setup Panel.
**Example: 150.02 should be rounded down to 150.00 unless requested by another mapper that it doesn't sound correct with reason.
*For fine-tuning of the offset, slow the song down to 0.5x (or even 0.25x if necessary) and adjust the values until the beats exactly coincide with the metronome ticks.
*Some songs have multiple BPMs. You can cater for this by adding a timing section (Timing --&gt; Add Timing Section) where the timing changes. The BPM and offset for the new timing section can be found exactly as before. The Timing Setup Panel gives a list of all timing sections in the song.

==What information do I enter in Song Setup?==
{{Main|IT:Song Setup#Song and Map Meta Data}}

You should enter this information before you create a second difficulty, to ensure that the description will be consistent across all of the maps in the set. You  are currently '''allowed to use Unicode characters.'''

|'''Artist'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The band, singer, or group that performed or created the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' osu! will pull the artist from the mp3 file, but please double check it to make sure it is spelled and punctuated correctly. '''Anime/Game titles or companies do not belong here (they belong to Tags).''' You can usually find the composer for anime and game songs on Wikipedia or other reliable sources such as [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ AnimeNewsNetwork] or [http://myanimelist.net/ MyAnimeList]. Foreign names should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency).
|-
|'''Romanised Artist''' 
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the artist of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency). This field will become active if you use Unicode characters in the ''Artist'' field.
|-
|'''Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It will be pulled automatically from the mp3 file, but double check for spelling or capitalization errors, especially if you get the mp3 online. Use only the official title of the song. 
|-
|'''Romanised Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' Again, this field will become active if you use Unicode characters in the ''Title'' field.
|-
|'''Beatmap Creator'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;That's you. osu! should handle this automatically, so you shouldn't edit this.&lt;/u&gt;''' If you are including a guest difficulty made by someone else, their name belongs in the Difficulty field below, not here.
|-
|'''Difficulty'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the difficulty of map.&lt;/u&gt;''' The dropdown contains the preset names: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane. You can select one of the default names, or create your own name. While it's good to be creative, try to make it very clear which one is harder than others as ambiguous difficulty names can annoy players. This would also be the field where you indicate a guest mapper, if this is their difficulty (e.g. &quot;Larto's Hard&quot;).
|-
|'''Source'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Where this song originate from.&lt;/u&gt;''' This field should generally only be included for Anime or Video Game songs, and occasionally for Novelty (Movies, TV, or Internet) songs. If the song is from an anime or video game, or is famous for its use as a TV or movie theme, the title of that source goes here.&lt;br&gt; Rock and Pop songs should generally leave the field blank. '''This is not to be used for things like album titles.'''
|-
|'''Tags'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Keywords to help in searches.&lt;/u&gt;''' Common uses include album names, guest difficulty creators, company name and other terms that may be used by people when searching for specific wants (like eroge or visual novel for example if your beatmap's song is based on an eroge visual novel). If your map has &quot;collab&quot; elements mapped by other mappers, their names can go here. Tags are separated by spaces. It is not compulsory to fill in but is greatly appreciated when using the Web search and osu! search in-game. &lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' If you have a tag of &quot;qwertyuiop&quot; as a tag on your beatmap, you can also find your beatmap in-game by typing in &quot;qwertyuiop&quot;.

Again, to avoid issues, please make sure that everything (aside from Difficulty name) is filled out identically for each difficulty.

=Fundamentals of Beatmapping=
==Bookmark==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot;
|-
! align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; scope=&quot;col&quot; | Bookmarking command
|-
|Ctrl + B||'''Add''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Shift + B||'''Remove''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Right Arrow||'''Next''' bookmark.
|-
|Ctrl + Left Arrow||'''Previous''' bookmark. 
|}

'''&lt;u&gt;Bookmark is a tool that marks the timeline.&lt;/u&gt;''' This is useful for planning out the specific places where you may want to place a BPM switch point or reserving space to place a complex design later. Depending on your preference, you may abuse this as you play the song while using the command based on the beat as a rough guide on how the beatmap would be.

==Adding normal hit circles==
This should be a straightforward and intuitive process. Below are some useful tips for Normal-type hit objects:-
*The grid level can be changed for more precision by going to View --&gt; Grid Level. Notes will automatically snap to the grid.
**You can override grid snapping and time snapping by holding Shift while performing a move/placement action.
*Right-clicking on a note or a selected group of notes will delete them. Right-clicking elsewhere will toggle a new combo.
*Common Windows shortcuts also apply in the osu! editor (e.g. Ctrl+A selects all notes, Ctrl+C/V is copy/paste, Ctrl+Z is undo).
*Notes will snap to visible sliders - so if you want to place a circle exactly on the end of a slider, place it while you can still see the slider and then move it forward/backward in the timeline if necessary. 

==Adding Sliders==
Before delving into sliders, do the following two things:

*Make sure you set the Slider Velocity (under the Timing tab) to your preferred value. This value will apply for the entire beatmap, so choose carefully! Changing Slider Velocity after placing sliders will result in wonky, mistimed sliders - try and avoid this eventuality!
*Set the type of slider you want. There are two types of curves - Bezier and Linear.
**Bezier is recommended as it produces the smoothest looking curves. 
**Linear mode is useful if you want sharp (e.g. 90 degree) corners in your sliders. 

Now you can begin adding a slider. Left-click to start the slider, add waypoints with further left-clicks, and terminate with a right-click to make a bezier slider. If you want to create a liner slider, make a bezier-shaped slider first, then left-clicking on an existing vertex will turn that vertex red and create a new anchor point to allow for sharp turns and new curves. It is recommended to make sure the length of the slider is correct before adjusting the shape. 

Here are some other tips regarding sliders:-
*To add repeats on a slider, drag the end of the slider in the timeline after finishing placement.
*Drag an individual waypoint to move it. Right-clicking removes a point, and Ctrl+clicking adds a point.
*In the same way as hit circles, you can override any snapping by holding shift. This can be useful for aligning sliders perfectly. 

Try and put some effort into making your sliders look nice! Lopsided/overlapped/wonky/plain-ugly sliders really ruin the look of a beatmap! Additionally, ensure that your sliders do not overlap one another, the tail end of your slider is always visible, and that the slider path is not obscured in any way - such as unpredictable U-turns or making the head and tail of the slider overlap. These slider-crafting pitfalls should be avoided!

==Adding Spinners==
To add a spinner to your map, left-click to begin it, then scroll the timeline to where you want the end to be, and terminate with a right-click. Try and keep your spinners to a reasonable length - overly long spinners are tiring and boring, whilst spinners that are too short are not nice. ^&quot;Spinner spam&quot; (as in, more than 5 spinner in one time) is a definite no-no! 

^&quot;Spinner Spam&quot; note: This is because [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/296 Trans-Siberian Orchestra - Wizards In Winter (Impossible difficulty)] have roughly 48~51 count in ~5 seconds. The beatmap itself contains lengthy streams of hit-circles and perfectly rankable if excluding the ninja spinner spam.

==What are Combos?==
Combos are groups of notes, essential to the scoring in osu!. Different combos have different colours. It is important that you use combos in your beatmaps to ensure better perception and understanding of the song stanza. Typically, combos should be based on the sound (drumming, guitar-streaming, singing) of the music in some way so pay attention to the stanzas displayed in the timing panel if you need some guidance. As a rough guide, a good length of a combo should be around 5-15 excluding streaming (10-30). 

Note: End combos (Geki and Katu specifically) will increase the HP bar by a good amount compared to typical 300. Short combos are preferred since longer combos yield less health in comparison and may cause the beatmap to become unnaturally hard due to HP drain.

==How do I add Breaks into my beatmap?==
To give players a bit of rest time during a longer beatmap, you should include a Break. To do this, simply leave a gap in the beatmap where you want the break to be, and click the &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; button in the editor. Note that you must insert a break between two hit objects, so place notes at the start and end to &quot;mark out&quot; the break before inserting one! 

A couple of rules of thumb are:-
*Generally, try to keep play segments below one minute long. A two minute song should have at least one break in it near the middle, a three minute song should have at least two breaks evenly spaced. This may change depending on the song used. 
*Keep break lengths reasonable. Breaks of less than 1 second are pretty pointless ([http://osu.ppy.sh/b/19842 unless you try to imitate the video game style by summoning warning-arrow]), and breaks of 30 seconds are hardly used and not practical. Try and aim for 5-15 second breaks. 

Here are some advanced tips on planning breaks through the use of Bookmarks:-
*Before you start the map, play through the song and decide where you want the breaks - try include one at regular intervals.
*Use bookmarks to mark out the start and end of each break on the timeline!
*Put in a temporary &quot;marker&quot; (a Normal hitcircle will do) at each bookmark, then click &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; whilst you are in between to add the break.

*An example is shown below:-
[[File:Osu-breaks.png]]
*Note how the breaks are evenly spaced throughout the song and are not too short/long, ensuring the player gets adequate recuperation from their intense clicking marathon, without falling asleep in the meantime! Breaks are displayed as the white brackets on the timeline at the bottom of the editor window.
*Notice the bookmark at the start of the song also, to mark the first note. Bookmarks are useful! Use them to your advantage.

==What is Beat Spacing?==
[[File:Beatspacing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A quick illustration]]
For intuitive play, your beatmaps should have good &quot;beat spacing&quot;! In general, beats that are close together on the timeline should be close together on the beatmap, and vice versa. This is to ensure the flow of the song sync with the beatmap design harmonically, making the beatmap much more enjoyable.

The simplest way to ensure beat spacing is correct on your beatmaps is to utilize the editor's [[IT:Distance Snap|Distance Snap]]ping function, found in the upper-right hand side of the editor. The relative distance between notes can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. If you stick to using Distance Snap for the whole song, correct beat spacing is guaranteed!

==How do I add more difficulty levels for a song?==
To make a new difficulty level, simply open your existing difficulty, choose &quot;File&quot; --&gt; &quot;Save As New Difficulty...&quot; and change the entry in the Difficulty box. 

Be sure to add variation between different difficulty levels. Add, take away or rearrange notes to make new patterns. Flip or rotate existing notes. The beatmap difficulties should feel familiar to some degree (like the speed of BPM, BPM change points or certain beatmap design) while ^retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty. 

'''Note:''' Changing the difficulty settings (e.g. HP drain rate) is not considered a new beatmap difficulty. This is called plain laziness, and will likely be requested to create a new beatmap design.

^&quot;retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty&quot;: Difference in beatmap design (as in, no exact repeated flipped design from Easy for Normal). 

==Why do combo numberings change as I play through the song?==
If you have a circle on your mouse cursor (i.e. you are in placement mode) it will act as if you have placed it - changing the combo numbers/colours for any circles that occur after it.

=Visualisation of beatmap=
==How do I change the background colour?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Set BG Colour&quot; which allows you to choose your own background colour. Theoretically speaking, it is most likely to be replaced by background image/video unless you are planning to use a storyboard.

==How do I add a background image or video?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Insert Background&quot;. When clicked, a dialog box will appear, allowing you to browse around your computer for the image or video you want to be added. The image/video will automatically be copied into the song folder, and will be included when submitting your beatmap. 

Some notes:-
*Images can be in .JPG or .PNG format. It is best if you keep them under 800x600 in size. (To save file size)
** Try to compress your images if possible. There are a couple of programs on the internet that can help you.
*Videos should be encoded using DiVX, xvid or similar codecs. Using codecs like H.264 is not recommended.
**Remove the audio of the video to decrease the file size.
*Images and videos can be removed by deleting them from the song folder. 

==How do I add custom images and sounds to my beatmap?==
*Create your desired image/sound file.
*Save it with an appropriate name. 
**Random name: For storyboard. Does exactly nothing when not implemented onto the beatmap.
***Example: A, Lyric1, 007, etc. (As long as you know which one is which one)
**Skin name: The beatmap will use the file automatically, replacing one of the player's skin element. You will notice this. 
***Example: normal-hitnormal (This sound file will be played instead of player skin's sound file)
*Drop it into your song's folder. 

[http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/729/start=0 A list of appropriate custom sound filenames can be found here.] 

==How do I create a storyboard to my beatmap?==
Click the &quot;Design&quot; tab to open up the SBE ([[IT:Storyboard Editor|Storyboard Editor]]).

=Keyboard Shortcuts=
==Are there any Keyboard Shortcuts?==
Yes, and here's a list of them. It is best you print them out for the sake of easier reference.

=What is &quot;Beatmapping&quot;?=
'''Beatmapping''' is the process of creating beatmaps in osu! for players to play.
It involves choosing a song, [[IT:Timing|timing]], placement of objects, and (optionally) [[IT:Skinning|skinning]] and [[IT:Storyboarding|storyboarding]].

To start, press the '''Edit''' button.

Mappers usually want to get their beatmaps [[IT:Ranked beatmap|ranked]], which consists of a [[IT:Beatmap approval|beatmap approval]] process, where when completed successfully, a scoreboard will be assigned onto the beatmap and is considered complete unless the mapper wish to add/change something to it.

The most common difficulties created in Beatmapping are:
* [[IT:Easy|Easy]]
* [[IT:Normal|Normal]]
* [[IT:Hard|Hard]]
* [[IT:Insane|Insane]]
Clicking each link will display a common set of guidelines [[IT:Mappers|mappers]] follow to be able to create an entertaining beatmap appropriate for its [[IT:Difficulty|difficulty]] level.

It is also not uncommon for [[IT:Mappers|mappers]] to use custom [[IT:Difficulty|difficulty]] names in place of these. (Like &quot;Mario&quot; for example)

Additionally you may find [[IT:Guest Difficulty|Guest Difficulties]] which are commonly labeled as mapper's difficulty (For example Larto's Insane).

With the addition of the Special modes, you can now add mod-specific difficulties to your beatmap other than the usual osu! difficulty. It is entirely possible to fill the beatmap with only Taiko/Catch the Beat/Osu!mania difficulties provided there is an Easy/Normal difficulty in it.

=Getting Started=
==How do I start a new beatmap?==
As osu! is a rhythm based game, the songs you choose to map should have an obvious and constant beat. Try to avoid songs which have tempo (speed) changes or slow songs until you are more experienced and used to the beatmapping mechanism. 

To start a new beatmap, follow these simple steps:-
*Drag and drop the audio file onto osu! (Opened or not is not an issue here) 
:Alternative route: Put audio file onto the &quot;Songs&quot; folder.
:*It should open and direct you to the edit screen with your audio file at there. 
:*Your new song will be at the bottom of the song list, highlighted in purple.
*Click on the song to open up Song Setup. 
**Insert and check that the song title and artist are correct, and add Source and Tags if necessary, then enter in an appropriate difficulty name (Easy, Insane and Cruisin' are examples, you can change it later anyway).
*You can set the other options now if you want, but they can be changed later on. Click OK, and you can start beatmapping! The next step is to add timing to your beatmap.

==How do I time a song properly?==
{{Main|IT:Timing}}
'''Timing is vital - incorrectly timed maps will not be considered for ranking.''' Make sure your timing is perfect before putting any notes in. If in doubt about timing, contact a mod for help first, or submit your song into the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10 Beatmap Help forum]. This will save a ''lot'' of hassle later on. 

Here are some tips for getting your timing right:-
*Watch the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/39317 video] [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/3815/ tutorials] for basic timing methods.
*Make sure the ticks of the metronome coincide with the beat of the song for the entire length of the song. So check the timing at 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the song, at the very least.
*Take a look at the BPM gauge. If the number is very close to a whole number (until .10 difference), it is probably better (unless requested not) to round down to that whole number. If so, manually enter in the correct BPM using the Timing Setup Panel.
**Example: 150.02 should be rounded down to 150.00 unless requested by another mapper that it doesn't sound correct with reason.
*For fine-tuning of the offset, slow the song down to 0.5x (or even 0.25x if necessary) and adjust the values until the beats exactly coincide with the metronome ticks.
*Some songs have multiple BPMs. You can cater for this by adding a timing section (Timing --&gt; Add Timing Section) where the timing changes. The BPM and offset for the new timing section can be found exactly as before. The Timing Setup Panel gives a list of all timing sections in the song.

==What information do I enter in Song Setup?==
{{Main|IT:Song Setup#Song and Map Meta Data}}

You should enter this information before you create a second difficulty, to ensure that the description will be consistent across all of the maps in the set. You  are currently '''allowed to use Unicode characters.'''

'''Anime/Game titles or companies do not belong here (they belong to Tags).''' You can usually find the composer for anime and game songs on Wikipedia or other reliable sources such as [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ AnimeNewsNetwork] or [http://myanimelist.net/ MyAnimeList]. Foreign names should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency).
|-
|'''Romanised Artist''' 
|'''&lt;u&gt;The romanised (English) name of the artist of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It should be presented in the same name order as used on Wikipedia (generally, Given Name followed by Family Name, the western order, for consistency). This field will become active if you use Unicode characters in the ''Artist'' field.
|-
|'''Title'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the song.&lt;/u&gt;''' It will be pulled automatically from the mp3 file, but double check for spelling or capitalization errors, especially if you get the mp3 online. Use only the official title of the song.

|-
|'''Difficulty'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;The name of the difficulty of map.&lt;/u&gt;''' The dropdown contains the preset names: Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane. You can select one of the default names, or create your own name. While it's good to be creative, try to make it very clear which one is harder than others as ambiguous difficulty names can annoy players. This would also be the field where you indicate a guest mapper, if this is their difficulty (e.g. &quot;Larto's Hard&quot;).
|-
|'''Source'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Where this song originate from.&lt;/u&gt;''' This field should generally only be included for Anime or Video Game songs, and occasionally for Novelty (Movies, TV, or Internet) songs. If the song is from an anime or video game, or is famous for its use as a TV or movie theme, the title of that source goes here.&lt;br&gt; Rock and Pop songs should generally leave the field blank. '''This is not to be used for things like album titles.'''
|-
|'''Tags'''
|'''&lt;u&gt;Keywords to help in searches.&lt;/u&gt;''' Common uses include album names, guest difficulty creators, company name and other terms that may be used by people when searching for specific wants (like eroge or visual novel for example if your beatmap's song is based on an eroge visual novel). If your map has &quot;collab&quot; elements mapped by other mappers, their names can go here. Tags are separated by spaces. It is not compulsory to fill in but is greatly appreciated when using the Web search and osu! search in-game. &lt;br&gt;'''Note:''' If you have a tag of &quot;qwertyuiop&quot; as a tag on your beatmap, you can also find your beatmap in-game by typing in &quot;qwertyuiop&quot;.

=Fundamentals of Beatmapping=
==Bookmark==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot;
|-
! align=&quot;center&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; scope=&quot;col&quot; | Bookmarking command
|-
|Ctrl + B||'''Add''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Shift + B||'''Remove''' bookmark at current location.
|-
|Ctrl + Right Arrow||'''Next''' bookmark.
|-
|Ctrl + Left Arrow||'''Previous''' bookmark. 
|}

'''&lt;u&gt;Bookmark is a tool that marks the timeline.&lt;/u&gt;''' This is useful for planning out the specific places where you may want to place a BPM switch point or reserving space to place a complex design later. Depending on your preference, you may abuse this as you play the song while using the command based on the beat as a rough guide on how the beatmap would be.

==Adding normal hit circles==
This should be a straightforward and intuitive process. Below are some useful tips for Normal-type hit objects:-
*The grid level can be changed for more precision by going to View --&gt; Grid Level. Notes will automatically snap to the grid.
**You can override grid snapping and time snapping by holding Shift while performing a move/placement action.
*Right-clicking on a note or a selected group of notes will delete them. Right-clicking elsewhere will toggle a new combo.
*Common Windows shortcuts also apply in the osu! editor (e.g. Ctrl+A selects all notes, Ctrl+C/V is copy/paste, Ctrl+Z is undo).
*Notes will snap to visible sliders - so if you want to place a circle exactly on the end of a slider, place it while you can still see the slider and then move it forward/backward in the timeline if necessary. 

==Adding Sliders==
Before delving into sliders, do the following two things:

*Make sure you set the Slider Velocity (under the Timing tab) to your preferred value. This value will apply for the entire beatmap, so choose carefully! Changing Slider Velocity after placing sliders will result in wonky, mistimed sliders - try and avoid this eventuality!
*Set the type of slider you want. There are two types of curves - Bezier and Linear.
**Bezier is recommended as it produces the smoothest looking curves. 
**Linear mode is useful if you want sharp (e.g. 90 degree) corners in your sliders. 

Now you can begin adding a slider. Left-click to start the slider, add waypoints with further left-clicks, and terminate with a right-click to make a bezier slider. If you want to create a liner slider, make a bezier-shaped slider first, then left-clicking on an existing vertex will turn that vertex red and create a new anchor point to allow for sharp turns and new curves. It is recommended to make sure the length of the slider is correct before adjusting the shape. 

Here are some other tips regarding sliders:-
*To add repeats on a slider, drag the end of the slider in the timeline after finishing placement.
*Drag an individual waypoint to move it. Right-clicking removes a point, and Ctrl+clicking adds a point.
*In the same way as hit circles, you can override any snapping by holding shift. This can be useful for aligning sliders perfectly. 

Try and put some effort into making your sliders look nice! Lopsided/overlapped/wonky/plain-ugly sliders really ruin the look of a beatmap! Additionally, ensure that your sliders do not overlap one another, the tail end of your slider is always visible, and that the slider path is not obscured in any way - such as unpredictable U-turns or making the head and tail of the slider overlap. These slider-crafting pitfalls should be avoided!

==Adding Spinners==
To add a spinner to your map, left-click to begin it, then scroll the timeline to where you want the end to be, and terminate with a right-click. Try and keep your spinners to a reasonable length - overly long spinners are tiring and boring, whilst spinners that are too short are not nice. ^&quot;Spinner spam&quot; (as in, more than 5 spinner in one time) is a definite no-no! 

^&quot;Spinner Spam&quot; note: This is because [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/296 Trans-Siberian Orchestra - Wizards In Winter (Impossible difficulty)] have roughly 48~51 count in ~5 seconds. The beatmap itself contains lengthy streams of hit-circles and perfectly rankable if excluding the ninja spinner spam.

==What are Combos?==
Combos are groups of notes, essential to the scoring in osu!. Different combos have different colours. It is important that you use combos in your beatmaps to ensure better perception and understanding of the song stanza. Typically, combos should be based on the sound (drumming, guitar-streaming, singing) of the music in some way so pay attention to the stanzas displayed in the timing panel if you need some guidance. As a rough guide, a good length of a combo should be around 5-15 excluding streaming (10-30). 

Note: End combos (Geki and Katu specifically) will increase the HP bar by a good amount compared to typical 300. Short combos are preferred since longer combos yield less health in comparison and may cause the beatmap to become unnaturally hard due to HP drain.

==How do I add Breaks into my beatmap?==
To give players a bit of rest time during a longer beatmap, you should include a Break. To do this, simply leave a gap in the beatmap where you want the break to be, and click the &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; button in the editor. Note that you must insert a break between two hit objects, so place notes at the start and end to &quot;mark out&quot; the break before inserting one! 

A couple of rules of thumb are:-
*Generally, try to keep play segments below one minute long. A two minute song should have at least one break in it near the middle, a three minute song should have at least two breaks evenly spaced. This may change depending on the song used. 
*Keep break lengths reasonable. Breaks of less than 1 second are pretty pointless ([http://osu.ppy.sh/b/19842 unless you try to imitate the video game style by summoning warning-arrow]), and breaks of 30 seconds are hardly used and not practical. Try and aim for 5-15 second breaks. 

Here are some advanced tips on planning breaks through the use of Bookmarks:-
*Before you start the map, play through the song and decide where you want the breaks - try include one at regular intervals.
*Use bookmarks to mark out the start and end of each break on the timeline!
*Put in a temporary &quot;marker&quot; (a Normal hitcircle will do) at each bookmark, then click &quot;Insert Break Time&quot; whilst you are in between to add the break.

*An example is shown below:-
[[File:Osu-breaks.png]]
*Note how the breaks are evenly spaced throughout the song and are not too short/long, ensuring the player gets adequate recuperation from their intense clicking marathon, without falling asleep in the meantime! Breaks are displayed as the white brackets on the timeline at the bottom of the editor window.
*Notice the bookmark at the start of the song also, to mark the first note. Bookmarks are useful! Use them to your advantage.

==What is Beat Spacing?==
[[File:Beatspacing.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A quick illustration]]
For intuitive play, your beatmaps should have good &quot;beat spacing&quot;! In general, beats that are close together on the timeline should be close together on the beatmap, and vice versa. This is to ensure the flow of the song sync with the beatmap design harmonically, making the beatmap much more enjoyable.

The simplest way to ensure beat spacing is correct on your beatmaps is to utilize the editor's [[IT:Distance Snap|Distance Snap]]ping function, found in the upper-right hand side of the editor. The relative distance between notes can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. If you stick to using Distance Snap for the whole song, correct beat spacing is guaranteed!

==How do I add more difficulty levels for a song?==
To make a new difficulty level, simply open your existing difficulty, choose &quot;File&quot; --&gt; &quot;Save As New Difficulty...&quot; and change the entry in the Difficulty box. 

Be sure to add variation between different difficulty levels. Add, take away or rearrange notes to make new patterns. Flip or rotate existing notes. The beatmap difficulties should feel familiar to some degree (like the speed of BPM, BPM change points or certain beatmap design) while ^retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty. 

'''Note:''' Changing the difficulty settings (e.g. HP drain rate) is not considered a new beatmap difficulty. This is called plain laziness, and will likely be requested to create a new beatmap design.

^&quot;retaining the distinctive difference in accordance to difficulty&quot;: Difference in beatmap design (as in, no exact repeated flipped design from Easy for Normal). 

==Why do combo numberings change as I play through the song?==
If you have a circle on your mouse cursor (i.e. you are in placement mode) it will act as if you have placed it - changing the combo numbers/colours for any circles that occur after it.

=Visualisation of beatmap=
==How do I change the background colour?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Set BG Colour&quot; which allows you to choose your own background colour. Theoretically speaking, it is most likely to be replaced by background image/video unless you are planning to use a storyboard.

==How do I add a background image or video?==
Click on the &quot;Design&quot; Tab. There is a button called &quot;Insert Background&quot;. When clicked, a dialog box will appear, allowing you to browse around your computer for the image or video you want to be added. The image/video will automatically be copied into the song folder, and will be included when submitting your beatmap. 

Some notes:-
*Images can be in .JPG or .PNG format. It is best if you keep them under 800x600 in size. (To save file size)
** Try to compress your images if possible. There are a couple of programs on the internet that can help you.
*Videos should be encoded using DiVX, xvid or similar codecs. Using codecs like H.264 is not recommended.
**Remove the audio of the video to decrease the file size.
*Images and videos can be removed by deleting them from the song folder. 

==How do I add custom images and sounds to my beatmap?==
*Create your desired image/sound file.
*Save it with an appropriate name. 
**Random name: For storyboard. Does exactly nothing when not implemented onto the beatmap.
***Example: A, Lyric1, 007, etc. (As long as you know which one is which one)
**Skin name: The beatmap will use the file automatically, replacing one of the player's skin element. You will notice this. 
***Example: normal-hitnormal (This sound file will be played instead of player skin's sound file)
*Drop it into your song's folder. 

[http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/729/start=0 A list of appropriate custom sound filenames can be found here.] 

==How do I create a storyboard to my beatmap?==
Click the &quot;Design&quot; tab to open up the SBE ([[IT:Storyboard Editor|Storyboard Editor]]).

=Keyboard Shortcuts=
==Are there any Keyboard Shortcuts?==
Yes, and here's a list of them. It is best you print them out for the sake of easier reference.

{{OL}}

{{RC}}

For the record, these include the recent changes made [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/87 from the discussion forum]. Any rule that is being discussed is listed here as it used to be and will be updated once the discussion reaches an agreement.

=Rules=
All rules are exactly that: RULES. They are NOT guidelines and may NOT be broken under ANY circumstance.

==General==
*'''No two hitobjects on the same tick (osu!mania game mode is an exception).''' This includes hit circles, starts and ends of sliders, and starts and ends of spinners. Although this may be possible to accomplish while playing, it defeats the purpose of following the rhythm of the song.
*'''Do not overuse kiai time.''' The general rule of thumb is one toggle per minute of playtime. Kiai is meant to accent chorus sections, so don't use it just for fountains unless you're doing this rarely. You can toggle kiai off and back on halfway through the chorus if it fits, but using it constantly every few beats/measures is just ridiculous and can distract players.
*'''Do not manually edit anything in an .osu file that cannot be changed through the Editor.''' The only exceptions are .osu-specific storyboards and skin-related options such as SliderBorder and SliderTrackOverride.
*'''There must not be any obscene imagery in the background/storyboard/video content.''' This includes nudity, near-nudity, sexual references, violence, drug abuse, etc. Keep things PG, suitable for ages 12+.
*'''Approved Category is only for Marathon maps.''' Long maps with over 5 minutes of draining time fit the Approval category. Only then they are allowed to be single difficulty mapsets. If they are below 5 minutes of draining time, a full difficulty spread is needed and the map will have to be ranked instead.

==Mapset==
*'''Mapsets must have at least two difficulties of the same game mode, one of which must be an Easy/Normal level.''' It is possible for Marathon difficulties to have only 1 difficulty, but it must be named Marathon for the BSS to allow the submission to pending.
*'''The mapset must have a well-designed spread of difficulties, containing at least an Easy or a Normal difficulty.''' This is so that players of all levels of experience are able to enjoy maps of the songs they love. 
*'''The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it.''' The order can be seen in the chart below. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. '''The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars'''. The difficulty level of Taiko-specific and osu!mania-specific difficulties must also follow a well-designed spread and might contain an Hard/Insane only, if there are standard difficulties present. In CtB, the spread evaluation is upon the BNs discretion. The difficulty spread is determined by the map's star rating. A map falls under a certain difficulty when having a specific star rating:
**Below 1.5: Easy
**Below 2.25: Normal
**Below 3.75: Hard
**Below 5.25: Insane 
**Above 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

==Timing==
*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible. If an incorrect time signature would last for more than 2 bars, add another timing section to fix it. Please see [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 this thread] for more information on downbeats. 
*'''Your map must be perfectly timed.''' This means that your BPM and offset are spot-on, sliders end when they should, notes are generally following a recognizable rhythm (such as the lyrics or drums) which is comprehensible by a player, and that there are no unsnapped notes (you can check this by running AIMod (shortcut ctrl+shift+a) in the editor).
*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.
*'''No two uninherited or two inherited timing sections should be placed at the same point.''' An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.
*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes. The bitrate of a beatmap's audio file must be no lower than 128kbps and no higher than 192kbps. If you are having trouble acquiring an appropriate audio file, contact one of the more audio-savvy BN; they will be more than happy to help find an mp3 for you.
*'''The minimum draining (play) time for a map is 30 seconds''' (but the recommended minimum is 45 seconds). If your map is shorter than that, then try looping the song with an audio editing program. This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive. If slider velocity changes are able to be merged (e.g. close values like 0.8x and 0.7x) while still flowing/working correctly, then they should be.
*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback). Also, storyboarded hitsounds at places where there are no objects can confuse the player into thinking there was some unseen hitobject, which doesn't make sense either.
*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

{{RC}}

For the record, these include the recent changes made [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/87 from the discussion forum]. Any rule that is being discussed is listed here as it used to be and will be updated once the discussion reaches an agreement.

=Rules=
All rules are exactly that: RULES. They are NOT guidelines and may NOT be broken under ANY circumstance.

==General==
*'''No two hitobjects on the same tick (osu!mania game mode is an exception).''' This includes hit circles, starts and ends of sliders, and starts and ends of spinners. Although this may be possible to accomplish while playing, it defeats the purpose of following the rhythm of the song.
*'''Do not overuse kiai time.''' The general rule of thumb is one toggle per minute of playtime. Kiai is meant to accent chorus sections, so don't use it just for fountains unless you're doing this rarely. You can toggle kiai off and back on halfway through the chorus if it fits, but using it constantly every few beats/measures is just ridiculous and can distract players.
*'''Do not manually edit anything in an .osu file that cannot be changed through the Editor.''' The only exceptions are .osu-specific storyboards and skin-related options such as SliderBorder and SliderTrackOverride.
*'''There must not be any obscene imagery in the background/storyboard/video content.''' This includes nudity, near-nudity, sexual references, violence, drug abuse, etc. Keep things PG, suitable for ages 12+.
*'''Approved Category is only for Marathon maps.''' Long maps with over 5 minutes of draining time fit the Approval category. Only then they are allowed to be single difficulty mapsets. If they are below 5 minutes of draining time, a full difficulty spread is needed and the map will have to be ranked instead.

==Mapset==
*'''Mapsets must have at least two difficulties of the same game mode, one of which must be an Easy/Normal level.''' It is possible for Marathon difficulties to have only 1 difficulty, but it must be named Marathon for the BSS to allow the submission to pending.
*'''The mapset must have a well-designed spread of difficulties, containing at least an Easy or a Normal difficulty.''' This is so that players of all levels of experience are able to enjoy maps of the songs they love. 
*'''The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it.''' The order can be seen in the chart below. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. '''The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars'''. The difficulty level of Taiko-specific and osu!mania-specific difficulties must also follow a well-designed spread and might contain an Hard/Insane only, if there are standard difficulties present. In CtB, the spread evaluation is upon the BNs discretion. The difficulty spread is determined by the map's star rating. A map falls under a certain difficulty when having a specific star rating:
**Below 1.5: Easy
**Below 2.25: Normal
**Below 3.75: Hard
**Below 5.25: Insane 
**Above 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive. If slider velocity changes are able to be merged (e.g. close values like 0.8x and 0.7x) while still flowing/working correctly, then they should be.
*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback). Also, storyboarded hitsounds at places where there are no objects can confuse the player into thinking there was some unseen hitobject, which doesn't make sense either.
*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

Questa pagina funge solo da archivio per i cambiamenti discussi [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/87 in questo thread]. Ogni regola che viene discussa verrà elencata di seguito una volta che si sarà raggiunta un'intesa.

=Regole=
Tutte le regole sono esattamente quello: REGOLE. Esse NON sono linee guida e NON vanno infrante in NESSUNA circostanza.

==General==
*'''No two hitobjects on the same tick (osu!mania game mode is an exception).''' This includes hit circles, starts and ends of sliders, and starts and ends of spinners. Although this may be possible to accomplish while playing, it defeats the purpose of following the rhythm of the song.
*'''Do not overuse kiai time.''' The general rule of thumb is one toggle per minute of playtime. Kiai is meant to accent chorus sections, so don't use it just for fountains unless you're doing this rarely. You can toggle kiai off and back on halfway through the chorus if it fits, but using it constantly every few beats/measures is just ridiculous and can distract players.
*'''Do not manually edit anything in an .osu file that cannot be changed through the Editor.''' The only exceptions are .osu-specific storyboards and skin-related options such as SliderBorder and SliderTrackOverride.
*'''There must not be any obscene imagery in the background/storyboard/video content.''' This includes nudity, near-nudity, sexual references, violence, drug abuse, etc. Keep things PG, suitable for ages 12+.
*'''Approved Category is only for Marathon maps.''' Long maps with over 5 minutes of draining time fit the Approval category. Only then they are allowed to be single difficulty mapsets. If they are below 5 minutes of draining time, a full difficulty spread is needed and the map will have to be ranked instead.

==Mapset==
*'''Mapsets must have at least two difficulties of the same game mode, one of which must be an Easy/Normal level.''' It is possible for Marathon difficulties to have only 1 difficulty, but it must be named Marathon for the BSS to allow the submission to pending.
*'''The mapset must have a well-designed spread of difficulties, containing at least an Easy or a Normal difficulty.''' This is so that players of all levels of experience are able to enjoy maps of the songs they love. 
*'''The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it.''' The order can be seen in the chart below. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. '''The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars'''. The difficulty level of Taiko-specific and osu!mania-specific difficulties must also follow a well-designed spread and might contain an Hard/Insane only, if there are standard difficulties present. In CtB, the spread evaluation is upon the BNs discretion. The difficulty spread is determined by the map's star rating. A map falls under a certain difficulty when having a specific star rating:
**Below 1.5: Easy
**Below 2.25: Normal
**Below 3.75: Hard
**Below 5.25: Insane 
**Above 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

==Timing==
*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible. If an incorrect time signature would last for more than 2 bars, add another timing section to fix it. Please see [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 this thread] for more information on downbeats. 
*'''Your map must be perfectly timed.''' This means that your BPM and offset are spot-on, sliders end when they should, notes are generally following a recognizable rhythm (such as the lyrics or drums) which is comprehensible by a player, and that there are no unsnapped notes (you can check this by running AIMod (shortcut ctrl+shift+a) in the editor).
*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.
*'''No two uninherited or two inherited timing sections should be placed at the same point.''' An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.
*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes. The bitrate of a beatmap's audio file must be no lower than 128kbps and no higher than 192kbps. If you are having trouble acquiring an appropriate audio file, contact one of the more audio-savvy BN; they will be more than happy to help find an mp3 for you.
*'''The minimum draining (play) time for a map is 30 seconds''' (but the recommended minimum is 45 seconds). If your map is shorter than that, then try looping the song with an audio editing program. This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive.

*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback).

*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

Tutte le regole sono esattamente quello: REGOLE. Esse NON sono linee guida e NON vanno infrante in NESSUNA circostanza.

==Generale==
*'''Non possono esserci due oggetti sullo stesso tick (osu!mania fa eccezione).''' Questo include i cerchi, l'inizio e la fine di ogni slider, l'inizio e la fine di ogni spinner. Seppur sia possibile portare a termine una cosa simile mentre si gioca, rovina lo scopo di seguire il ritmo della canzone.
*'''Non abusare del kiai time.''' Come regola generale si prende massimo un scambio per minuto di gioco. Il kiai è pensato per accentuare i ritornelli, non deve essere usato solo per le fontane di stelle, a meno che non lo si usi raramente. Se lo ritieni necessario puoi sempre disattivarlo per poi riattivarlo subito dopo a metà ritornello, ma non utilizzare tale tecnica ad ogni battuta/nota: è ridicolo e può distrarre i giocatori.
*'''Non alterare nulla nel .osu file che non sia modificabile direttamente dall'editor.''' Le uniche eccezioni sono le storyboards specifiche per ogni .osu e le opzioni personalizzate per la skin, come SliderBorder e SliderTrackOVerride.
*'''Non deve essere presente alcun materiale osceno nel contenuto del background/storyboard/video.''' Questo include scene di nudo, quasi-nudo, riferimenti sessuali, violenza, abuso di droga, ecc. Mantieni il materiale adatto per un pubblico PG12+
*'''La categoria Approved è riservato per le Maratone.''' Mappe che superano i 5 minuti di gioco possono ricadere in tale categoria. Solo a queste è concesso di avere un mapset composto da una sola difficoltà. Se il tempo di gioco è inferiore ai 5 minuti la mappa necessiterà di un mapset completo di tutte le difficoltà e sarà di conseguenza considerata Ranked invece.

==Mapset==
*'''Mapsets must have at least two difficulties of the same game mode, one of which must be an Easy/Normal level.''' It is possible for Marathon difficulties to have only 1 difficulty, but it must be named Marathon for the BSS to allow the submission to pending.
*'''The mapset must have a well-designed spread of difficulties, containing at least an Easy or a Normal difficulty.''' This is so that players of all levels of experience are able to enjoy maps of the songs they love. 
*'''The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it.''' The order can be seen in the chart below. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. '''The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars'''. The difficulty level of Taiko-specific and osu!mania-specific difficulties must also follow a well-designed spread and might contain an Hard/Insane only, if there are standard difficulties present. In CtB, the spread evaluation is upon the BNs discretion. The difficulty spread is determined by the map's star rating. A map falls under a certain difficulty when having a specific star rating:
**Below 1.5: Easy
**Below 2.25: Normal
**Below 3.75: Hard
**Below 5.25: Insane 
**Above 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

==Timing==
*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible. If an incorrect time signature would last for more than 2 bars, add another timing section to fix it. Please see [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 this thread] for more information on downbeats. 
*'''Your map must be perfectly timed.''' This means that your BPM and offset are spot-on, sliders end when they should, notes are generally following a recognizable rhythm (such as the lyrics or drums) which is comprehensible by a player, and that there are no unsnapped notes (you can check this by running AIMod (shortcut ctrl+shift+a) in the editor).
*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.
*'''No two uninherited or two inherited timing sections should be placed at the same point.''' An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.
*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes. The bitrate of a beatmap's audio file must be no lower than 128kbps and no higher than 192kbps. If you are having trouble acquiring an appropriate audio file, contact one of the more audio-savvy BN; they will be more than happy to help find an mp3 for you.
*'''The minimum draining (play) time for a map is 30 seconds''' (but the recommended minimum is 45 seconds). If your map is shorter than that, then try looping the song with an audio editing program. This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive. If slider velocity changes are able to be merged (e.g. close values like 0.8x and 0.7x) while still flowing/working correctly, then they should be.
*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback). Also, storyboarded hitsounds at places where there are no objects can confuse the player into thinking there was some unseen hitobject, which doesn't make sense either.
*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes. The bitrate of a beatmap's audio file must be no lower than 128kbps and no higher than 192kbps. If you are having trouble acquiring an appropriate audio file, contact one of the more audio-savvy BN; they will be more than happy to help find an mp3 for you.
*'''The minimum draining (play) time for a map is 30 seconds''' (but the recommended minimum is 45 seconds). If your map is shorter than that, then try looping the song with an audio editing program. This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive. If slider velocity changes are able to be merged (e.g. close values like 0.8x and 0.7x) while still flowing/working correctly, then they should be.
*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback). Also, storyboarded hitsounds at places where there are no objects can confuse the player into thinking there was some unseen hitobject, which doesn't make sense either.
*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

Questa pagina funge solo da archivio per i cambiamenti discussi [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/87 in questo thread]. Ogni regola che viene discussa verrà elencata di seguito una volta che si sarà raggiunta un'intesa.

=Regole=
Tutte le regole sono esattamente quello: REGOLE. Esse NON sono linee guida e NON vanno infrante in NESSUNA circostanza.

==Generale==
*'''Non possono esserci due oggetti sullo stesso tick (osu!mania fa eccezione).''' Questo include i cerchi, l'inizio e la fine di ogni slider, l'inizio e la fine di ogni spinner. Seppur sia possibile portare a termine una cosa simile mentre si gioca, rovina lo scopo di seguire il ritmo della canzone.
*'''Non abusare del kiai time.''' Come regola generale si prende massimo un scambio per minuto di gioco. Il kiai è pensato per accentuare i ritornelli, non deve essere usato solo per le fontane, a meno che non lo si usi raramente. Se lo ritieni necessario puoi sempre disattivarlo brevemente a metà del kiai, ma non utilizzare tale tecnica ad ogni battuta/nota: è ridicolo e può distrarre i giocatori.
*'''Non alterare nulla nel .osu file che non sia modificabile direttamente dall'editor.''' Le uniche eccezioni sono le storyboards specifiche per ogni .osu e le opzioni personalizzate per la skin, come SliderBorder e SliderTrackOVerride.
*'''Non deve essere presente alcun materiale osceno nel contenuto del background/storyboard/video.''' Questo include scene di nudo, quasi-nudo, riferimenti sessuali, violenza, abuso di droga, ecc. Mantieni il materiale adatto per un pubblico PG12+
*'''La categoria Approved è riservato per le Maratone.''' Mappe che superano i 5 minuti di gioco possono ricadere in tale categoria. Solo a queste è concesso di avere un mapset composto da una sola difficoltà. Se il tempo di gioco è inferiore ai 5 minuti la mappa necessiterà di un mapset completo di tutte le difficoltà e sarà di conseguenza considerata Ranked invece.

==Mapset==
*'''Mapsets must have at least two difficulties of the same game mode, one of which must be an Easy/Normal level.''' It is possible for Marathon difficulties to have only 1 difficulty, but it must be named Marathon for the BSS to allow the submission to pending.
*'''The mapset must have a well-designed spread of difficulties, containing at least an Easy or a Normal difficulty.''' This is so that players of all levels of experience are able to enjoy maps of the songs they love. 
*'''The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it.''' The order can be seen in the chart below. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. '''The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars'''. The difficulty level of Taiko-specific and osu!mania-specific difficulties must also follow a well-designed spread and might contain an Hard/Insane only, if there are standard difficulties present. In CtB, the spread evaluation is upon the BNs discretion. The difficulty spread is determined by the map's star rating. A map falls under a certain difficulty when having a specific star rating:
**Below 1.5: Easy
**Below 2.25: Normal
**Below 3.75: Hard
**Below 5.25: Insane 
**Above 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

==Timing==
*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible. If an incorrect time signature would last for more than 2 bars, add another timing section to fix it. Please see [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 this thread] for more information on downbeats. 
*'''Your map must be perfectly timed.''' This means that your BPM and offset are spot-on, sliders end when they should, notes are generally following a recognizable rhythm (such as the lyrics or drums) which is comprehensible by a player, and that there are no unsnapped notes (you can check this by running AIMod (shortcut ctrl+shift+a) in the editor).
*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.
*'''No two uninherited or two inherited timing sections should be placed at the same point.''' An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.
*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes.

This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine.

The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.

*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.

Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480).

*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive. If slider velocity changes are able to be merged (e.g. close values like 0.8x and 0.7x) while still flowing/working correctly, then they should be.
*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback). Also, storyboarded hitsounds at places where there are no objects can confuse the player into thinking there was some unseen hitobject, which doesn't make sense either.
*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

Questa pagina funge solo da archivio per i cambiamenti discussi [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/87 in questo thread]. Ogni regola che viene discussa verrà elencata di seguito una volta che si sarà raggiunta un'intesa.

=Regole=
Tutte le regole sono esattamente quello: REGOLE. Esse NON sono linee guida e NON vanno infrante in NESSUNA circostanza.

==Generale==
*'''Non possono esserci due oggetti sullo stesso tick (osu!mania fa eccezione).''' Questo include i cerchi, l'inizio e la fine di ogni slider, l'inizio e la fine di ogni spinner. Seppur sia possibile portare a termine una cosa simile mentre si gioca, rovina lo scopo di seguire il ritmo della canzone.
*'''Non abusare del kiai time.''' Come regola generale si prende massimo un scambio per minuto di gioco. Il kiai è pensato per accentuare i ritornelli, non deve essere usato solo per le fontane, a meno che non lo si usi raramente. Se lo ritieni necessario puoi sempre disattivarlo brevemente a metà del kiai, ma non utilizzare tale tecnica ad ogni battuta/nota: è ridicolo e può distrarre i giocatori.
*'''Non alterare nulla nel .osu file che non sia modificabile direttamente dall'editor.''' Le uniche eccezioni sono le storyboards specifiche per ogni .osu e le opzioni personalizzate per la skin, come SliderBorder e SliderTrackOVerride.
*'''Non deve essere presente alcun materiale osceno nel contenuto del background/storyboard/video.''' Questo include scene di nudo, quasi-nudo, riferimenti sessuali, violenza, abuso di droga, ecc. Mantieni il materiale adatto per un pubblico PG12+
*'''La categoria Approved è riservato per le Maratone.''' Mappe che superano i 5 minuti di gioco possono ricadere in tale categoria. Solo a queste è concesso di avere un mapset composto da una sola difficoltà. Se il tempo di gioco è inferiore ai 5 minuti la mappa necessiterà di un mapset completo di tutte le difficoltà e sarà di conseguenza considerata Ranked invece.

==Mapset==
*'''Mapsets must have at least two difficulties of the same game mode, one of which must be an Easy/Normal level.''' It is possible for Marathon difficulties to have only 1 difficulty, but it must be named Marathon for the BSS to allow the submission to pending.
*'''The mapset must have a well-designed spread of difficulties, containing at least an Easy or a Normal difficulty.''' This is so that players of all levels of experience are able to enjoy maps of the songs they love. 
*'''The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it.''' The order can be seen in the chart below. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. '''The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars'''. The difficulty level of Taiko-specific and osu!mania-specific difficulties must also follow a well-designed spread and might contain an Hard/Insane only, if there are standard difficulties present. In CtB, the spread evaluation is upon the BNs discretion. The difficulty spread is determined by the map's star rating. A map falls under a certain difficulty when having a specific star rating:
**Below 1.5: Easy
**Below 2.25: Normal
**Below 3.75: Hard
**Below 5.25: Insane 
**Above 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

==Timing==
*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible. If an incorrect time signature would last for more than 2 bars, add another timing section to fix it. Please see [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 this thread] for more information on downbeats. 
*'''Your map must be perfectly timed.''' This means that your BPM and offset are spot-on, sliders end when they should, notes are generally following a recognizable rhythm (such as the lyrics or drums) which is comprehensible by a player, and that there are no unsnapped notes (you can check this by running AIMod (shortcut ctrl+shift+a) in the editor).
*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.
*'''No two uninherited or two inherited timing sections should be placed at the same point.''' An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.
*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes. The bitrate of a beatmap's audio file must be no lower than 128kbps and no higher than 192kbps. If you are having trouble acquiring an appropriate audio file, contact one of the more audio-savvy BN; they will be more than happy to help find an mp3 for you.
*'''The minimum draining (play) time for a map is 30 seconds''' (but the recommended minimum is 45 seconds). If your map is shorter than that, then try looping the song with an audio editing program. This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.

*'''The mapset must have a well-designed spread of difficulties, containing at least an Easy or a Normal difficulty.''' This is so that players of all levels of experience are able to enjoy maps of the songs they love. 
*'''The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it.''' The order can be seen in the chart below. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. '''The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars'''. The difficulty level of Taiko-specific and osu!mania-specific difficulties must also follow a well-designed spread and might contain an Hard/Insane only, if there are standard difficulties present. In CtB, the spread evaluation is upon the BNs discretion. The difficulty spread is determined by the map's star rating. A map falls under a certain difficulty when having a specific star rating:
**Below 1.5: Easy
**Below 2.25: Normal
**Below 3.75: Hard
**Below 5.25: Insane 
**Above 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

==Timing==
*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible. If an incorrect time signature would last for more than 2 bars, add another timing section to fix it. Please see [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 this thread] for more information on downbeats. 
*'''Your map must be perfectly timed.''' This means that your BPM and offset are spot-on, sliders end when they should, notes are generally following a recognizable rhythm (such as the lyrics or drums) which is comprehensible by a player, and that there are no unsnapped notes (you can check this by running AIMod (shortcut ctrl+shift+a) in the editor).
*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.
*'''No two uninherited or two inherited timing sections should be placed at the same point.''' An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.
*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes. The bitrate of a beatmap's audio file must be no lower than 128kbps and no higher than 192kbps. If you are having trouble acquiring an appropriate audio file, contact one of the more audio-savvy BN; they will be more than happy to help find an mp3 for you.
*'''The minimum draining (play) time for a map is 30 seconds''' (but the recommended minimum is 45 seconds). If your map is shorter than that, then try looping the song with an audio editing program. This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive. If slider velocity changes are able to be merged (e.g. close values like 0.8x and 0.7x) while still flowing/working correctly, then they should be.
*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback). Also, storyboarded hitsounds at places where there are no objects can confuse the player into thinking there was some unseen hitobject, which doesn't make sense either.
*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

Questa pagina funge solo da archivio per i cambiamenti discussi [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/87 in questo thread]. Ogni regola che viene discussa verrà elencata di seguito una volta che si sarà raggiunta un'intesa.

=Regole=
Tutte le regole sono esattamente questo: REGOLE. Esse NON sono linee guida e NON vanno infrante in NESSUNA circostanza.

==Generale==
*'''Non possono esserci due oggetti sullo stesso tick (osu!mania fa eccezione).''' Questo include i cerchi, l'inizio e la fine di ogni slider, l'inizio e la fine di ogni spinner. Seppur sia possibile portare a termine una cosa simile mentre si gioca, rovina lo scopo di seguire il ritmo della canzone ed è perciò vietato.
*'''Non abusare del kiai time.''' Come regola generale si prende massimo un scambio per minuto di gioco. Il kiai è pensato per accentuare i ritornelli, non deve essere usato solo per le fontane, a meno che non lo si usi raramente. Se lo ritieni necessario puoi sempre disattivarlo brevemente a metà del kiai, ma non utilizzare tale tecnica ad ogni battuta/nota: è ridicolo e può distrarre i giocatori.
*'''Non alterare nulla nel .osu file che non sia modificabile direttamente dall'editor.''' Le uniche eccezioni sono le storyboards specifiche per ogni .osu e le opzioni personalizzate per la skin, come SliderBorder e SliderTrackOverride.
*'''Non deve essere presente alcun materiale osceno nel contenuto del background/storyboard/video.''' Questo include scene di nudo, quasi-nudo, riferimenti sessuali, violenza, abuso di droga, ecc. Mantieni il materiale adatto per un pubblico PG12+
*'''La categoria Approved è riservato per le Maratone.''' Mappe che superano i 5 minuti di gioco possono ricadere in tale categoria. Solo a queste è concesso di avere un mapset composto da una sola difficoltà. Se il tempo di gioco è inferiore ai 5 minuti la mappa necessiterà di un mapset completo di tutte le difficoltà e sarà di conseguenza considerata Ranked, non Approved.

==Mapset==
*'''I mapset devono contenere almeno due difficoltà per ciascuna modalità di gioco, una delle quali deve essere una Easy/Normal.''' Per le Maratone è possibile avere una sola difficoltà, ma deve essere nominata &quot;Marathon&quot; affinché il BSS ne consenta il caricamento sul sito.
*'''Il mapset deve avere uno spread ben definito ed omogeneo, che contenga almeno una Easy oppure una Normal.''' Questo lo si impone al fine di intrattenere i giocatori di ogni livello con le canzoni che più amano. 
*'''Le difficoltà nel mapset devono essere in ordine consecutivo. Le Easy o le Normal possono essere tralasciate se l'intervallo fra le difficoltà lo permette.''' L'ordine lo trovate di seguito. Se il mapset contiene solo due difficoltà in totale non potete avere una Insane o una Extra. '''La difficoltà più bassa deve restare entro le 2.0 stelle'''. Le difficoltà specifiche per Taiko e Mania devono anche esse seguire uno spread ragionevole e possono contenere una Hard/Insane al massimo, se sono presenti le difficoltà per standard. Per quanto riguarda CtB, la valutazione dello spread viene lasciata al giudizio dei BN. Lo spread della difficoltà viene determinato dallo star rating della mappa. Una mappa ricade in una certa difficoltà se ha uno specifico star rating:
**Entro 1.5: Easy
**Entro 2.25: Normal
**Entro 3.75: Hard
**Entro 5.25: Insane 
**Oltre 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.

*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible.

*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.

An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.

If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive. If slider velocity changes are able to be merged (e.g. close values like 0.8x and 0.7x) while still flowing/working correctly, then they should be.
*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback). Also, storyboarded hitsounds at places where there are no objects can confuse the player into thinking there was some unseen hitobject, which doesn't make sense either.
*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

Questa pagina funge solo da archivio per i cambiamenti discussi [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/87 in questo thread]. Ogni regola che viene discussa verrà elencata di seguito una volta che si sarà raggiunta un'intesa.

=Regole=
Tutte le regole sono esattamente questo: REGOLE. Esse NON sono linee guida e NON vanno infrante in NESSUNA circostanza.

==Generale==
*'''Non possono esserci due oggetti sullo stesso tick (osu!mania fa eccezione).''' Questo include i cerchi, l'inizio e la fine di ogni slider, l'inizio e la fine di ogni spinner. Seppur sia possibile portare a termine una cosa simile mentre si gioca, rovina lo scopo di seguire il ritmo della canzone ed è perciò vietato.
*'''Non abusare del kiai time.''' Come regola generale si prende massimo un scambio per minuto di gioco. Il kiai è pensato per accentuare i ritornelli, non deve essere usato solo per le fontane, a meno che non lo si usi raramente. Se lo ritieni necessario puoi sempre disattivarlo brevemente a metà del kiai, ma non utilizzare tale tecnica ad ogni battuta/nota: è ridicolo e può distrarre i giocatori.
*'''Non alterare nulla nel .osu file che non sia modificabile direttamente dall'editor.''' Le uniche eccezioni sono le storyboards specifiche per ogni .osu e le opzioni personalizzate per la skin, come SliderBorder e SliderTrackOverride.
*'''Non deve essere presente alcun materiale osceno nel contenuto del background/storyboard/video.''' Questo include scene di nudo, quasi-nudo, riferimenti sessuali, violenza, abuso di droga, ecc. Mantieni il materiale adatto per un pubblico PG12+
*'''La categoria Approved è riservato per le Maratone.''' Mappe che superano i 5 minuti di gioco possono ricadere in tale categoria. Solo a queste è concesso di avere un mapset composto da una sola difficoltà. Se il tempo di gioco è inferiore ai 5 minuti la mappa necessiterà di un mapset completo di tutte le difficoltà e sarà di conseguenza considerata Ranked, non Approved.

==Mapset==
*'''I mapset devono contenere almeno due difficoltà per ciascuna modalità di gioco, una delle quali deve essere una Easy/Normal.''' Per le Maratone è possibile avere una sola difficoltà, ma deve essere nominata &quot;Marathon&quot; affinché il BSS ne consenta il caricamento sul sito.
*'''Il mapset deve avere uno spread ben definito ed omogeneo, che contenga almeno una Easy oppure una Normal.''' Questo lo si impone al fine di intrattenere i giocatori di ogni livello con le canzoni che più amano. 
*'''Le difficoltà nel mapset devono essere in ordine consecutivo. Le Easy o le Normal possono essere tralasciate se l'intervallo fra le difficoltà lo permette.''' L'ordine lo trovate di seguito. Se il mapset contiene solo due difficoltà in totale non potete avere una Insane o una Extra. '''La difficoltà più bassa deve restare entro le 2.0 stelle'''. Le difficoltà specifiche per Taiko e Mania devono anche esse seguire uno spread ragionevole e possono contenere una Hard/Insane al massimo, se sono presenti le difficoltà per standard. Per quanto riguarda CtB, la valutazione dello spread viene lasciata al giudizio dei BN. Lo spread della difficoltà viene determinato dallo star rating della mappa. Una mappa ricade in una certa difficoltà se ha uno specifico star rating:
**Entro 1.5: Easy
**Entro 2.25: Normal
**Entro 3.75: Hard
**Entro 5.25: Insane 
**Oltre 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

==Timing==
*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible. If an incorrect time signature would last for more than 2 bars, add another timing section to fix it. Please see [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 this thread] for more information on downbeats. 
*'''Your map must be perfectly timed.''' This means that your BPM and offset are spot-on, sliders end when they should, notes are generally following a recognizable rhythm (such as the lyrics or drums) which is comprehensible by a player, and that there are no unsnapped notes (you can check this by running AIMod (shortcut ctrl+shift+a) in the editor).
*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.
*'''No two uninherited or two inherited timing sections should be placed at the same point.''' An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.
*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes. The bitrate of a beatmap's audio file must be no lower than 128kbps and no higher than 192kbps. If you are having trouble acquiring an appropriate audio file, contact one of the more audio-savvy BN; they will be more than happy to help find an mp3 for you.
*'''The minimum draining (play) time for a map is 30 seconds''' (but the recommended minimum is 45 seconds). If your map is shorter than that, then try looping the song with an audio editing program. This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided.

Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive. If slider velocity changes are able to be merged (e.g. close values like 0.8x and 0.7x) while still flowing/working correctly, then they should be.
*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback). Also, storyboarded hitsounds at places where there are no objects can confuse the player into thinking there was some unseen hitobject, which doesn't make sense either.
*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

Questa pagina funge solo da archivio per i cambiamenti discussi [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/87 in questo thread]. Ogni regola che viene discussa verrà elencata di seguito una volta che si sarà raggiunta un'intesa.

=Regole=
Tutte le regole sono esattamente questo: REGOLE. Esse NON sono linee guida e NON vanno infrante in NESSUNA circostanza.

==Generale==
*'''Non possono esserci due oggetti sullo stesso tick (osu!mania fa eccezione).''' Questo include i cerchi, l'inizio e la fine di ogni slider, l'inizio e la fine di ogni spinner. Seppur sia possibile portare a termine una cosa simile mentre si gioca, rovina lo scopo di seguire il ritmo della canzone ed è perciò vietato.
*'''Non abusare del kiai time.''' Come regola generale si prende massimo un scambio per minuto di gioco. Il kiai è pensato per accentuare i ritornelli, non deve essere usato solo per le fontane, a meno che non lo si usi raramente. Se lo ritieni necessario puoi sempre disattivarlo brevemente a metà del kiai, ma non utilizzare tale tecnica ad ogni battuta/nota: è ridicolo e può distrarre i giocatori.
*'''Non alterare nulla nel .osu file che non sia modificabile direttamente dall'editor.''' Le uniche eccezioni sono le storyboards specifiche per ogni .osu e le opzioni personalizzate per la skin, come SliderBorder e SliderTrackOverride.
*'''Non deve essere presente alcun materiale osceno nel contenuto del background/storyboard/video.''' Questo include scene di nudo, quasi-nudo, riferimenti sessuali, violenza, abuso di droga, ecc. Mantieni il materiale adatto per un pubblico PG12+
*'''La categoria Approved è riservato per le Maratone.''' Mappe che superano i 5 minuti di gioco possono ricadere in tale categoria. Solo a queste è concesso di avere un mapset composto da una sola difficoltà. Se il tempo di gioco è inferiore ai 5 minuti la mappa necessiterà di un mapset completo di tutte le difficoltà e sarà di conseguenza considerata Ranked, non Approved.

==Mapset==
*'''I mapset devono contenere almeno due difficoltà per ciascuna modalità di gioco, una delle quali deve essere una Easy/Normal.''' Per le Maratone è possibile avere una sola difficoltà, ma deve essere nominata &quot;Marathon&quot; affinché il BSS ne consenta il caricamento sul sito.
*'''Il mapset deve avere uno spread ben definito ed omogeneo, che contenga almeno una Easy oppure una Normal.''' Questo lo si impone al fine di intrattenere i giocatori di ogni livello con le canzoni che più amano. 
*'''Le difficoltà nel mapset devono essere in ordine consecutivo. Le Easy o le Normal possono essere tralasciate se l'intervallo fra le difficoltà lo permette.''' L'ordine lo trovate di seguito. Se il mapset contiene solo due difficoltà in totale non potete avere una Insane o una Extra. '''La difficoltà più bassa deve restare entro le 2.0 stelle'''. Le difficoltà specifiche per Taiko e Mania devono anche esse seguire uno spread ragionevole e possono contenere una Hard/Insane al massimo, se sono presenti le difficoltà per standard. Per quanto riguarda CtB, la valutazione dello spread viene lasciata al giudizio dei BN. Lo spread della difficoltà viene determinato dallo star rating della mappa. Una mappa ricade in una certa difficoltà se ha uno specifico star rating:
**Entro 1.5: Easy
**Entro 2.25: Normal
**Entro 3.75: Hard
**Entro 5.25: Insane 
**Oltre 5.25: Expert
*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

==Timing==
*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible. If an incorrect time signature would last for more than 2 bars, add another timing section to fix it. Please see [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 this thread] for more information on downbeats. 
*'''Your map must be perfectly timed.''' This means that your BPM and offset are spot-on, sliders end when they should, notes are generally following a recognizable rhythm (such as the lyrics or drums) which is comprehensible by a player, and that there are no unsnapped notes (you can check this by running AIMod (shortcut ctrl+shift+a) in the editor).
*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.
*'''No two uninherited or two inherited timing sections should be placed at the same point.''' An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.
*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes. The bitrate of a beatmap's audio file must be no lower than 128kbps and no higher than 192kbps. If you are having trouble acquiring an appropriate audio file, contact one of the more audio-savvy BN; they will be more than happy to help find an mp3 for you.
*'''The minimum draining (play) time for a map is 30 seconds''' (but the recommended minimum is 45 seconds). If your map is shorter than that, then try looping the song with an audio editing program. This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive.

*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.

*'''A difficulty's name must indicate its level of difficulty, with the exception of the hardest level of difficulty in a set.''' The mapset's hardest difficulty may use an appropriate custom difficulty name, unrelated to a username. Mapsets may also use a complete set of custom difficulty names that clearly indicate their level of difficulty to the player. Marathon maps with a single difficulty may use free naming.
*'''Each difficulty must be able to be played by a single player.''' Thus, Multiplayer TAG-specific difficulties are not allowed since multiple people are required to play them. However, you may add an external link to a TAG difficulty in your map thread.
*'''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko or osu!mania difficulty.''' If you decide, for example, to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty. However having only one CtB difficulty is fine.
*'''Having just one CtB difficulty is allowed in an osu!standard mapset''' because standard difficulties are converted correctly to CtB. Thus, in Taiko or osu!mania mapsets you need at least 2 CtB difficulties since Taiko and osu!mania can't be converted to CtB.
*'''No guest mapper should have more difficulties in the mapset than the creator, all modes together'''. For collaboration mapsets, the uploader should take part in all collab difficulties. The person who should upload the map is the one who contributed most to it. Maps with an ambiguous set of difficulties such as collabs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the submitting mapper is properly accounted for.

==Metadata==
*'''Metadata must be consistent across all difficulties.''' This is to ensure that searching is consistent and clean across a mapset.
*'''Eastern artists must be written in the proper 'surname firstname' format''' (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean). For artists which have a preferred romanisation, use this one. If you're unsure of your artist's name, then check previously ranked maps, Google, Wikipedia, or ask a BN for help.
*'''Songs with Japanese titles must use the Modified Hepburn method of romanisation in the &quot;Romanised Title&quot; field. '''As a non-unicode field, long vowels such as &quot;おう&quot; and &quot;うう&quot; should be romanised into &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;uu&quot; to avoid macrons. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language.
*'''Songs with Chinese titles must be romanised in this method: each character must be romanised into a single, capitalised, separated word.''' The official romanization should be used if provided. Loan words should be expressed using romanisation from the original language. Refer to [https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/244684 Thread: Romanisation of Chinese] for more information.
*'''Vocaloids can be featured within the artist section if the producer/composer includes it via official sources.''' This ensures that we enforce metadata being accurate in all cases.
*'''Do not alter the song's title.''' This includes adding any marker to describe the cut of the song such as &quot;Short Ver.&quot;, &quot;TV Size&quot; and so forth unless those markers are part of the official song title as listed by a reputable source.
*'''Only use the Source field if the song comes from or was made famous by a video game, movie, or series.''' Website names are not an acceptable Artist nor Source.
*'''Tracks created by composers belonging to doujin circles should list the circle's name as the main composer.''' The sole exception to this is when a composer of a given circle is well-known enough by their own name. In this case, their own composer name may be used instead.
*'''The information of multiple mapset contributors must be provided in the mapset, if there is any guest mapper.''' This might be in the creator's words, via a storyboard or via naming the guest difficulties appropriately. You only need to provide information of guest mapper and corresponding guest part. '''Guest mappers must be added to the tags of a mapset.''' This helps others to know if the map uploader is the main contributor of the mapset and who else contributed to the given mapset.

==Timing==
*'''Uninherited (red) Timing Sections should be used to accurately map the song's timing.''' They should synchronize to the beats of the song as accurately as possible and use the correct time signature whenever possible. If an incorrect time signature would last for more than 2 bars, add another timing section to fix it. Please see [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 this thread] for more information on downbeats. 
*'''Your map must be perfectly timed.''' This means that your BPM and offset are spot-on, sliders end when they should, notes are generally following a recognizable rhythm (such as the lyrics or drums) which is comprehensible by a player, and that there are no unsnapped notes (you can check this by running AIMod (shortcut ctrl+shift+a) in the editor).
*'''Uninherited timing sections must be the same in every difficulty''' of the mapset. That is, each section must have the same BPM and offset in each difficulty. Furthermore, there must not be extra or missing uninherited sections in any difficulty. A song's timing doesn't change between difficulties, so there's no sense in having different uninherited sections per difficulty.
*'''Uninherited timing sections cannot be used to manipulate slider speeds.''' These can be very unexpected for the player while also disrupting the main menu pulse and slightly changing the overall timing of the map.
*'''No two uninherited or two inherited timing sections should be placed at the same point.''' An inherited timing section may be placed on an uninherited timing section (but only to change the slider speed). Having two uninherited or two inherited sections on top of each other will cause problems within the beatmap.

==Audio==
*'''A beatmap set may only contain one music file used by all difficulties.''' Multiple music files within a single beatmap set is unsupported by osu! and results in unexpected behaviour with preview times, metadata, etc.
*'''The song's audio file must be of reasonable quality.''' Try and source mp3 files yourself; ripping them from a streaming video site often results in low quality audio with high file sizes. The bitrate of a beatmap's audio file must be no lower than 128kbps and no higher than 192kbps. If you are having trouble acquiring an appropriate audio file, contact one of the more audio-savvy BN; they will be more than happy to help find an mp3 for you.
*'''The minimum draining (play) time for a map is 30 seconds''' (but the recommended minimum is 45 seconds). If your map is shorter than that, then try looping the song with an audio editing program. This is so each map gives a high enough score, and also so people do not try and cut songs too short for no reason, thus stopping people from enjoying the song fully. 
*'''You must cut your mp3 if you're using less than 80% of it.''' This doesn't count intro time, and thus only applies if more than 20% of the outro is unmapped. If you only plan to map a portion of your song, then including the full mp3 is a waste of file space. Many mp3 editing tools [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=34303 like this] exist which make fading and cutting a song simple. However, if you have a legitimate reason for keeping your full mp3 (e.g. a storyboard after the map ends), then that is fine. 
*'''You must use hitsounds.''' Without these, things get way too monotonous as you are throwing away one of the main elements of variation present in mapping. You don't need to place them on every note (and are discouraged from doing so), but they must at least be frequently heard when playing.
*'''Hitsounds from notes and sliders must be audible.''' These provide feedback for the player, and having them silent in a rhythm game doesn't make much sense. If you don't like the default sounds, then find replacements rather than silencing notes. You can use hitsounds from the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&amp;t=15407 Custom Hitsound Library] or easily find others online. Lowering the volume of a few notes to provide a dampened effect is usually fine, but complete silence is always unacceptable. The end of a spinner (or even the entire spinner) the sliding sound of a slider, and the end of a slider can be silent, but only do it if it makes sense. Finally, you cannot silence both slider ticks and slider slides together.
*'''Songs/Maps with mature lyrics/themes must be marked with a label such as &quot;18+&quot; in the map's thread.''' This game is for all ages, and so a warning is needed for younger audiences. There is currently no way to distinguish this outside of the map's thread, but this may change in the future.
*'''Each difficulty of the mapset must have a preview point set''' (and be consistent in every difficulty). This is used for both the song selection menu and the online thumbnail preview.
*'''Every .wav file must be at least 100ms long''' to prevent issues with soundcards. If you want a silent/blank hitsound, then you &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use a [http://up.ppy.sh/files/blank.wav 0-byte .wav file].
*'''Hitsounds must have an acceptable range of delay under 5ms, unless there's a special purpose.''' Every hitsound file should start in time, preferrably at 0ms. This is to ensure that every map doesn't sound mistimed, and therefore could provide acceptably synchronized rhythm feedback to players.

==Video==
*'''A beatmap set may not contain multiple background video files.''' Multiple videos within a single beatmap set is not supported by osz2 and will result in errors during upload and processing.
*'''The video's dimensions must not exceed 1280x720.''' As well, upscaling lower resolution video to a higher resolution should be avoided. This ensures video files do not become excessively large or resource intensive.
*'''The video's offset must be correct and consistent between difficulties''' so that it follows the music how it was originally meant to be.
*'''The video's audio track must be removed from the video file.''' The audio track in video is not used in osu!, so removing it reduces that filesize of the beatmap.

==Skinning==
*'''If you are using any elements created by another community member, ask permission beforehand.''' Respecting the work of others is paramount and most people will be delighted to have their work featured in your projects!
*'''Gameplay elements must be visible.''' You cannot make any element that will impair the playability of the map invisible as it will make the map unintuitive or even impossible to play.
*'''Skinned elements must be cropped cleanly''' so they don't look like they have jpeg or pixelated artifacts around them or half-cropped shadows. If you don't have a program like Photoshop, then there are many free alternatives like Paint.NET and GIMP that can be used instead.
*'''Background images must be at a maximum of 1024x768 pixels for 4:3, 1366x768 pixels for 16:9.''' Although 1366x768 (16:9) is recommended, most background ratios that are 4:3 or 16:9 should also work reasonably well (for example, 800x600 or 852x480). Using an image with a different ratio is fine, but will result in letterboxing (black bars at the top/bottom of the screen) or upscaling (resized image to fill the whole screen).
*'''Keep background imagery safe.''' Images should be on a level that can be displayed on all-audience TV, on public signage, and of nature that doesn't require censoring in any country. If you have any possible edge-case scenarios, please PM peppy on IRC with a link to the image in question; a list of images which are/aren't acceptable will be built up to set some visible guidelines.
*'''You must have a background image on every difficulty of your map.''' If your map has a storyboard, then you can easily fade the background out, but one is still required for the song selection menu, online thumbnail icon, and for players not downloading with video (if the map has one).
*'''Hitbursts must be clearly distinguishable from each other''' (e.g. 300/100). The best way to ensure this is to use a different color for each hitburst. Otherwise, the player won't know if they're hitting beats accurately.
*'''When skinning gameplay elements, [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning#Skin_Sets complete sets] of elements must be skinned'''. For instance, if you skin hitcircles, you must include a hitcircle.png, hitcircleoverlay.png, approachcircle.png, and a slider border color (this can be done by adding the line &quot;SliderBorder: 255,255,255&quot; (using RGB values) under the [Colours] section of each .osu file). The same logic applies to hitbursts, cursors, numbers, and anything else of this nature. If you didn't intend to skin an element in the set, then using the templateskin's version is okay. Setting a SkinPreference is also acceptable (e.g. forcing the default skin).
*'''Combobursts must be oriented for the left side of the screen.''' Combobursts are aligned to the bottom and left sides of the screen by default, and are just horizontally flipped for the right side. Thus, you only need to worry about making sure that the comboburst is cleanly cropped on the top and right sides of the image.
*'''Do not make any essential gameplay elements larger than template skin dimensions''' (especially for combobursts). Larger elements may effect gameplay performance, and thus should be avoided. However, any elements that do not directly effect gameplay (e.g. pause-back, play-skip, etc.) may be slightly larger if a legitimate reason is given.
*'''There must not be any unused files in the map's folder''' except for the map's .osb file (since they sometimes get added even if the map doesn't have a storyboard) and storyboard .thumb files (since they are automatically created in image directories). Unused files add extra file size which is unnecessary.

==Storyboarding==
*'''Storyboard images must be at a reasonable filesize and dimension for their usage.''' For most uses (e.g. full-screen images), the maximum is 1366x768 pixels. For widescreen storyboards 854x480 is preferred as it matches the internal resolution of the SB editor. For 4:3 aspect ratio images 640x480 is preferred.
*'''The maximum dimensions for tall or wide scrolling images are 640x1440 and 1920x480 respectively.''' This is for the sake of gameplay performance, image loading time, and filesize.
*'''There must not be any unnecessary transparency around storyboarded images,''' so crop and resize them as much as possible. If there are particular reasons for apparently useless transparency, then please explain them. For transparent sprites, there should be at least one pixel of transparent border around them so that interpolation (e.g. a black-bordered image on a black background) works properly (although a shadow or glow around the image will fix this problem as well).
*'''Maps that use repetitive strobes, pulsing images, or flashing colors in the storyboard &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt; use the epilepsy warning.''' There is one built-into the editor, which will display a visual warning at the beginning of the map and also mark the map's online thumbnail with a warning icon. Also, it helps to make a note of the flashing/strobes/etc. in the map's thread. This warning is absolutely needed so that players with epilepsy can avoid any danger.

=Guidelines=
Guidelines are important and should be followed in most maps. However, they are NOT rules, so they may be broken in special cases. If you want to break a guideline, ask yourself this: Does what I'm about to do make sense? Is it more fun to play like this compared to sticking to the guidelines? If you answer yes to both these questions, then it is probably okay.

When your guideline-breaking map gets modded, try to be as reasonable as possible: Do your best to explain your point of view and be open to suggestions.

*'''The difficulty spread should be linear and reasonable.''' Linear difficulty spread means your difficulties have a comparable gap in star rating between each other. A reasonable spread means the usage of [http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Difficulty_appropriate_gameplay_elements difficulty appropriate gameplay elements]. If your mapset does not have an Easy difficulty your Normal difficulty should follow the general guidelines for Easy difficulties. If your Insane difficulty is at or above a 5 star rating it is recommended to include another Insane level difficulty between Hard and the 5+ Insane.
*'''A maximum of three slider velocities should be used''' (including 1x). For example, you could have a single map using 0.6x, 0.8x, and 1x; or 0.75x, 1x, and 1.5x; etc. If more than three slider velocities are used, then they should make sense and be intuitive. If slider velocity changes are able to be merged (e.g. close values like 0.8x and 0.7x) while still flowing/working correctly, then they should be.
*'''When including a slider velocity change, there should be a discernible change in the map's tempo'''. A spacing change, a short break in the map, or a slider containing at least one tick will help show the transition between them.
*'''Make sure that you can pass each difficulty in your mapset.''' Continually test-playing your map is one of the best ways to spot mistakes and correct issues. 
*'''Your difficulties should all end at the same spot.''' Having a fully-mapped Normal/Hard and a half-mapped Easy just looks sloppy/lazy. A full Easy may look boring to you, but not to a player that can't handle the harder difficulties.
*'''Kiai should be consistent throughout difficulties''' of your mapset (especially since it is shown on the main menu). If you have a guest difficulty from another mapper that uses different kiai, then it's fine as long as it still makes sense.
*'''Kiai should start on a white tick''' (or more commonly, the big white tick called the [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=20998 downbeat]) of a measure. Generally, the main part of the chorus will start at this point.
*'''The song should not be too long.''' Aim for 3 minutes maximum; anything longer gets tiring. If you need help editing a song down to length, feel free to ask in the Beatmap [http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=56 General Questions] forum.
*'''Use breaks where possible.''' Even if they are only 5-10 seconds, it allows a bit of recovery and hand repositioning for players. However, try to avoid longer breaks that are in excess of 15 seconds. Breaks should especially be used with Easy/Normal difficulties.
*'''Options such as letterboxing, countdown, and audio lead-in should be consistent between difficulties.''' Having cohesive settings throughout your mapset will look much more professional, although there are always scenarios where this is impossible. One difficulty might start at the beginning of the mp3, where a countdown is impossible but an audio lead-in is absolutely necessary; while another difficulty may start a few seconds in, where a countdown is usable but an audio lead-in is senseless.
*'''Try to keep osz files under 10mb, or 24mb if you include a video/storyboard.''' Videos and storyboards can generally be decreased in size by lowering the quality of the video or trimming/resizing storyboard elements.
*'''Avoid using storyboarded hitsounds.''' If a player misses the hitobject that the storyboarded hitsound lands on, then the hitsound will be played (which doesn't make much sense when this is a rhythm game utilizing audio feedback). Also, storyboarded hitsounds at places where there are no objects can confuse the player into thinking there was some unseen hitobject, which doesn't make sense either.
*'''Slider tick hitsounds are discouraged.''' If you want to use them, then make sure that their volume is balanced (i.e. notably quieter than regular hitsounds). A very loud slider tick, especially when only used once or twice, would be extremely jarring.
*'''Avoid going over a 5.0x storyboard load''' to help prevent lag on older computers. Resizing some of your storyboard images may help with this.

La creazione di una skin è una delle cose fondamentale di tutte le modalità di gioco di osu!. Essa permette agli utenti di creare una propria skin attraverso la modifica degli elementi della skin originale.

== Introduzione alle skin==
Con il passare degli danni, le skin di osu! sono cambiate in modo radicale. Vi sono davvero molti modi differenti che permettono la creazione di una skin, grazie alla presenza di numerose guide all'interno del forum ([https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/15 forum inglese])

Le skin possono essere create in modo da essere incentrate su temi particolari (Ad esempio quelle dedicate agli anime/manga), che però influiscono particolarmente sulla giocabilità, oppure create per migliorare la fluidità di gioco, rendendo gli elementi più importanti più in evidenza ed eliminando tutto ciò che è in eccesso.

&lt;!--Necessiti di aiuto? (Discussione in inglese) --&gt;

'''Articolo originale: [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning QUI]'''


La creazione di una skin è una delle cose fondamentale di tutte le modalità di gioco di osu!. Essa permette agli utenti di creare una propria skin attraverso la modifica degli elementi della skin originale.

== Introduzione alle skin==
Con il passare degli danni, le skin di osu! sono cambiate in modo radicale. Vi sono davvero molti modi differenti che permettono la creazione di una skin, grazie alla presenza di numerose guide all'interno del forum ([https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/15 forum inglese])

Le skin possono essere create in modo da essere incentrate su temi particolari (Ad esempio quelle dedicate agli anime/manga), che però influiscono particolarmente sulla giocabilità, oppure create per migliorare la fluidità di gioco, rendendo gli elementi più importanti più in evidenza ed eliminando tutto ciò che è in eccesso.

&lt;!--Necessiti di aiuto? (Discussione in inglese) --&gt;
== The Basic of Skinning ==

== Versioni delle skin ==

! 1
! 1.0

|-
! rowspan=&quot;5&quot; | 2
! 2.0
| 2013  Modifiche globali, con l'aggiunta di nuovi spinners e miglioramenti generali.
|-
! 2.1
| Uguale alla 2.0, ma include miglioramenti anche per la modalità di gioco Taiko.
|-
! 2.2
| Introduce un nuovo stile per il &quot;pannello&quot; dedicato alle beatmap. Include anche la rotazione delle stelle e miglioramenti di tutti gli elementi.
|-
! 2.3
| Stessa cosa della 2.2, ma include la nuova mascot Yuzu [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Mascots Clicca qui per saperne di più], ed delle nuove combobursts.
|-
! 2.4
| È stato scalato il contatore delle combo di osu! mania, insieme alle luci e le frecce di avvertimento. In generale tutto ciò che riguarda osu! mania è stato rimpicciolito.

== Mancanza di elementi ==

Nel caso in cui la tua skin non avesse degli elementi, questi ultimi verranno rimpiazzati con quella di skin di default.

'''Articolo originale: [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning QUI]'''


La creazione di una skin è una delle cose fondamentale di tutte le modalità di gioco di osu!. Essa permette agli utenti di creare una propria skin attraverso la modifica degli elementi della skin originale.

== Introduzione alle skin==
Con il passare degli danni, le skin di osu! sono cambiate in modo radicale. Vi sono davvero molti modi differenti che permettono la creazione di una skin, grazie alla presenza di numerose guide all'interno del forum ([https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/15 forum inglese])

Le skin possono essere create in modo da essere incentrate su temi particolari (Ad esempio quelle dedicate agli anime/manga), che però influiscono particolarmente sulla giocabilità, oppure create per migliorare la fluidità di gioco, rendendo gli elementi più importanti più in evidenza ed eliminando tutto ciò che è in eccesso.

'''Articolo originale: [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning QUI]'''


La creazione di una skin è una delle cose fondamentale di tutte le modalità di gioco di osu!. Essa permette agli utenti di creare una propria skin attraverso la modifica degli elementi della skin originale.

== Introduzione alle skin==
Con il passare degli danni, le skin di osu! sono cambiate in modo radicale. Vi sono davvero molti modi differenti che permettono la creazione di una skin, grazie alla presenza di numerose guide all'interno del forum ([https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/15 forum inglese])

Le skin possono essere create in modo da essere incentrate su temi particolari (Ad esempio quelle dedicate agli anime/manga), che però influiscono particolarmente sulla giocabilità, oppure create per migliorare la fluidità di gioco, rendendo gli elementi più importanti più in evidenza ed eliminando tutto ciò che è in eccesso.

&lt;!--Necessiti di aiuto? (Discussione in inglese) --&gt;

== Versioni delle skin ==

|-

|-

== Mancanza di elementi ==

Nel caso in cui la tua skin non avesse degli elementi, questi ultimi verranno rimpiazzati con quella di skin di default.

'''Articolo originale: [https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Skinning QUI]'''


La creazione di una skin è una delle cose fondamentale di tutte le modalità di gioco di osu!. Essa permette agli utenti di creare una propria skin attraverso la modifica degli elementi della skin originale.

== Introduzione alle skin==
Con il passare degli danni, le skin di osu! sono cambiate in modo radicale. Vi sono davvero molti modi differenti che permettono la creazione di una skin, grazie alla presenza di numerose guide all'interno del forum ([https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/15 forum inglese])

Le skin possono essere create in modo da essere incentrate su temi particolari (Ad esempio quelle dedicate agli anime/manga), che però influiscono particolarmente sulla giocabilità, oppure create per migliorare la fluidità di gioco, rendendo gli elementi più importanti più in evidenza ed eliminando tutto ciò che è in eccesso.

&lt;!--Necessiti di aiuto? (Discussione in inglese) --&gt;

== Mancanza di elementi ==

Nel caso in cui la tua skin non avesse degli elementi, questi ultimi verranno rimpiazzati con quella di skin di default.

La creazione di una skin è una delle cose fondamentale di tutte le modalità di gioco di osu!. Essa permette agli utenti di creare una propria skin attraverso la modifica degli elementi della skin originale.

== Introduzione alle skin==
Con il passare degli danni, le skin di osu! sono cambiate in modo radicale. Vi sono davvero molti modi differenti che permettono la creazione di una skin, grazie alla presenza di numerose guide all'interno del forum ([https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/15 forum inglese])

Le skin possono essere create in modo da essere incentrate su temi particolari (Ad esempio quelle dedicate agli anime/manga), che però influiscono particolarmente sulla giocabilità, oppure create per migliorare la fluidità di gioco, rendendo gli elementi più importanti più in evidenza ed eliminando tutto ciò che è in eccesso.

&lt;!--Necessiti di aiuto? (Discussione in inglese) --&gt;

== Versioni delle skin ==
