To contribute to the new wiki, you're going to need a [GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to be able to make changes to the new wiki.

If you have a GitHub account already however, you can head to the [osu!wiki repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki). You should be acquainted by this screen.

Congratualtions, you made it to the new wiki's repository! 

However, you can't edit here as you need to "fork" the repository to be able to propose changes to the upstream wiki. To do that, you would need to click the fork button on the upper-right corner.

You should come across with this kind of dialogue to prompt you where to place the fork.

Your profile would show up in this dialogue. Click on your profile and the forking process would begin
automatically.

> **Note**: If you have a fork already and its commits behind master, don't worry!
> You can [sync](#Syncing_Fork) your fork to the upstream repository instead of starting
> from clean slate again.

After the forking process is complete, you would be greeted with the osu!wiki repository,
this time, under your own name! 

From here, you can make your own changes.
