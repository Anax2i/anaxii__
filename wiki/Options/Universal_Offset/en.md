Universal Offset
----------------

Universal Offset adjusts the audio offset so that the hits would be timed correctly. You can find this option under [Options](Options "wikilink").

Setting the Universal Offset
----------------------------

In order to set it correctly, you need to do the following:

1.  Go to the options and turn down the Effects volume to 0%.
2.  Download [this](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/4659) beatmap.
3.  Find it in your beatmap list.
4.  Press F3 and 5.
5.  Scroll with your mouse a little bit, then go almost to the start of the beatmap.
6.  Click on the "Test" button.
7.  Hear the beat, see when you should be hitting the circles.
8.  Start over, close your eyes, and click to the beat. You have to click for ~16 times.
9.  Open your eyes and look how much you got your ms too early or too late.
10. Go to options and set your Universal Offset by -X if it was too late and X if it was too early.
11. Do 2-9 steps again, this time the too early / too late values should be smaller.
12. Repeat 10th step until the difference gets really small (Â±4ms).
13. Enjoy *actually* clicking to the rhythm!

#### Notice

Changing the video setting to fullscreen or vice versa (full screen is recommended because of lower input lag) could make the offset require calibration. Effects volume set to 0% is recommended, because it might be delayed, therefore, could mess things up. Not sure if it works correctly for DT/NC.

This info is for the [osu! Standard](Standard "wikilink") mode, therefore other modes like [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink") or [osu!mania](osu!mania "wikilink") might require different offsets.
