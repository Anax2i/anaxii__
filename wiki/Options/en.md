### Universal Audio Offset

_See also [Detailed calibration method](/wiki/Options/Universal_Offset)_

If, in every single beatmap you play, you hear the sound effects out of sync with the song, you might need to adjust this value. Click and hold on the selector, then drag left or right. You can also place the cursor on the selector and move it using the left and right arrow keys. Continue adjusting until you find the position where the two different sounds are heard simultaneously. Alternatively, you can use _Run Offset Wizard_ for a more graphical representation of ticks.

Unlike Local Song Offset (specific to that difficulty only) , this offset affects *every* beatmap you play. If you received an Online Offset, you can manually adjust it yourself for the difficulty you are playing using `+` or `-` to increase/decrease the beatmap's offset by 5ms (holding `Alt` while pressing `+` or `-` will allow you to change the offset by 1ms).

#### Offset Wizard

Click on "Run Offset Wizard" bar to adjust your Universal Audio Offset in a more graphical method.

Note: Your current playing song on your jukebox will be used.

1.  This displays your current Universal Audio Offset in terms of milliseconds.
2.  Clicking on "Half tick" will display slower, half ticks on the screen likewise clicking "Double tick" will show faster, double ticks.
3.  These are the ticks. They will pass through a green flashing line in the middle of the screen and will emit ticking sounds to represent beats.
4.  Click the Back button or press Esc to return to the Graphics tab of the Options Screen. This will update the Universal Audio Offset.
5.  Your jukebox. The currently playing song's BPM is shown as ticks.
