  
Use essentially the same technique for any sliders that are rotationally symmetrical

![](MGS_02.png "MGS_02.png")

Waves are made very similarly to arcs, only your points should be rotationally symmetrical with each other as opposed to horizontally flipped. If you press Ctrl + H + J it rotates the slider by 180 Degrees so you can check the points correspond.

To line the slider-end and endpoint up choose two corresponding symmetrical points. Disable grid snap and move them both in by a tiny bit at a time until the slider-end and last point are right on top of each other.
