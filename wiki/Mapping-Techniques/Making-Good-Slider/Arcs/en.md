  
Use essentially the same technique for any sliders symmetrical in one axis

This is the easiest shape to make. Place all of your points symmetrically in the grid first of all. Select it and Ctrl+H when you think you have it accurate to make sure the points are on symmetrical grids. Then move the points around until the slider is the right length and falls just a little short of the final point. It's important that whenever you move a point, you move the corresponding point exactly the same way to keep all the points symmetrical with each other. Make sure you Ctrl+H often to check you haven't made a mistake.

To make the slider-end and endpoint line up hold shift to disable grid snap and move the top point down until the slider-end is right on the last point. When you think it's perfect, select and Ctrl+H a few times and see if the endpoint moves around. If it doesn't, congratulations, you have a beautiful slider. Show it off to your friends. If it does, move the top point around until it does.

If you want an arc at an angle, it's usually easiest to make it upright as above, then Edit &gt; Rotate By... to make it the angle you want.
