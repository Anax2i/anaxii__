Przez lata, społeczność osu! stworzyła swój własny slang, który może być mylący dla nowych graczy. Ta strona jest kompilacją większości terminów.

### Abandoned Wasteland

Jest to ukryte podforum. Jeżeli sama nazwa nie mówi ci wszystkiego, instrukcje dawane moderatorom zajmującym się nim to: "Wsadzajcie tutaj rzeczy których nie potrzebujemy". Kiedy jakikolwiek wątek jest "opuszczony", jest przenoszony tutaj.

### AiMod

Jest to funkcja [edytora beatmap](PL:Beatmap_Editor "wikilink"), aktywowana po jednoczesnym wciśnięciu Ctrl+Shift+A. AiMod wychwyca błędy które mogą uniemożliwić uzyskanie statusu rankingowej mapy, a więc mapperzy powinni tego używać.

### Approval

Jest to słowo określające [beatmapę](#Beatmap "wikilink") która powinna nierankingowa z kilku powodów (długość, wynik itd.), ale została zaakceptowana przez grupę [\#BAT](#BAT "wikilink"). Te beatmapy posiadają własne tabele wyników. Jednak wyniki uzyskane na takich mapach nie są dodawane do Globalnego Wyniku. Te beatmapy są rozpoznawalne po ikonce "płomienia".

### Authentic

Jest to słowo określające [beatmapę](#Beatmap "wikilink") która naśladuje każdy aspekt specyficznego poziomu z [gier na konsolę DS](#DS_games "wikilink") (piosenka, ustawienia, ułożenie [obiektów](#Object "wikilink") itd.)

### Bancho

An easily expandable server coded by [peppy](peppy "wikilink"), which replaces third-party irc servers in the management of all online content in [osu!](#osu! "wikilink"). Players automatically connect to Bancho when they start osu!

### Banchobot

To jest bot (czyli zbiór komend z automatycznymi odpowiedziami) zaprogramowany przez Echo49 który pomaga ludziom z czatu poprzez wyświetlanie odpowiednich informacji i ogłaszanie wiadomości dotyczących gry.

### BAT

Jest to skrót od Nominatorów Beatmap ([Beatmap Appreciation Team](PL:Beatmap_Nomination_Group "wikilink")), grupy użytkowników którzy zajmują się [zatwierdzaniem](PL:Approved_Beatmap "wikilink") [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink").

### Beat

Term that applies to the timeline in [Editor](Editor "wikilink") mode. A period of time songs can be divided into according to their [BPM](#Timing "wikilink"). In correctly [timed](#Timing "wikilink") [beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink"), each beat corresponds to the song's rhythm. A whole beat falls between two white lines on the timeline. Depending on the position of your [Snap Divisor](Beat_Snap_Divisor "wikilink"), other lines dividing a beat may be visible: Red lines for half beats, blue lines for quarter beats, yellow lines for eighth beats and purple lines for third and sixth beats.

### Beat Spacing

A principle which states that [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") and [Sliders](Slider "wikilink") that correspond to parts of the song close to each other on the timeline should be close together on the play field, and vice versa. Simply put, "close in time = close in space". You can see some examples [here](http://peppy.chigau.com/Beat%20Spacing.jpg). Consistent Beat Spacing is generally a requirement to [rank](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") a beatmap because it provides the player with a more intuitive experience, as he will learn to move their cursor along the screen at a constant speed. Placing objects closer than Beat Spacing would indicate tricks the player into clicking on them too soon, while placing them too far forces the player to race their cursor across the screen to click on them in time. A common exception to Beat Spacing is [stacked](#Stacked "wikilink") [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"). To ensure consistent Beat Spacing, turn the [Distance Snap](Distance_Snap "wikilink") button on the right-hand side of the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") screen on. Then, choose a Beat Spacing value by holding Alt and sliding the selector at the top right until you reach the desired value. The higher the value, the more difficult the [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink").

### Beatmap

Also called map for short. A game level in [osu!](#osu! "wikilink"), like each stage in the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink"). At their most basic form, beatmaps have a song and [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), [Sliders](Slider "wikilink"), and/or [Spinners](#Spinner "wikilink") placed according to the rhythm of the music, but they can also have a background image or video, or even a [Storyboard](Storyboarding "wikilink"). Creators of beatmaps are called beatmappers or mappers for short. Beatmaps are uploaded for everyone to see and play with using the [BSS](#BSS "wikilink"), and are then [modded](Modding "wikilink"). If/Once a beatmap is deemed good enough, it is [ranked](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") or, in rare cases, [approved](Approved_Beatmap "wikilink").

### Break

A part in a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") where no [objects](#Object "wikilink") appear and [drain](#Drain "wikilink") in the [Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") is temporarily halted. Breaks allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their input device. A break is also accompanied by a graphic illustrating whether the player is doing well (the Life Bar is over a certain point) or poorly (the Life Bar is under it). In the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") as well as beatmaps with [Storyboards](Storyboarding "wikilink"), this graphic is accompanied by a fitting plot development. Roughly speaking, breaks should be placed, if possible, between every 40 seconds-1 minute and 20 seconds of playtime and last about 5-15 seconds, but according to the way each song is composed, possible break placement may vary.

### BSS

Jest to skrót od [Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") Submission System. Automatyczny proces dzięki któremu można wysyłać swoje beatmapy na forum Beatmap Help albo Completed Beatmaps, aby ludzie mogli ją widzieć, komentować, [modować](PL:Modding "wikilink") i [uczynić rankingową](PL:Ranked_beatmap "wikilink"). Pozwala na [Standardowe Wysyłanie](PL:Submission "wikilink") i [Pełne Wysyłanie](PL:Submission "wikilink").

### Bubble

A stage in a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink")'s [modding](modding "wikilink") process where a [BAT](Beatmap_Appreciation_Team "wikilink"), [GMT](Beatmap_Appreciation_Team "wikilink"), [MAT](Modding_Assistance_Team "wikilink") is satisfied with every aspect of the beatmap and nominates it for [ranking](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink"). Denoted by a thought bubble graphic by the beatmap's thread title. The beatmap is then ranked if a BAT/GMT seconds that nomination. A bubble might be downgraded to a [star](#Star "wikilink") under certain circumstances, but never removed altogether.

### Build

A version of the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") application. Each build includes improvements, additions and fixes of problems the previous one had. There are two kinds of Builds: the [Test Build](#Test_Build "wikilink") and the [Public Build](#Public_Build "wikilink"). One can download the most current Build by running the appropriate [Updater](#Updater "wikilink").

C
-

### Changelog

The forum thread where [peppy](peppy "wikilink") details the day-by-day improvements, additions and bug fixes made in everything concerning [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") You can view it [here](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/changelog). Everyday changes are added to the [Test Build](#Test_Build "wikilink") and are eventually added to the [Public Build](#Public_Build "wikilink").

### Choke

Almost [FCing](#Full_Combo "wikilink") the whole beatmap but losing combo near the end. A reverse choke is known as losing combo at the beginning but [FCing](#Full_combo "wikilink") the rest of the map.

### Clap

A sound effect, part of a [sample set](#Sample_Set "wikilink"), usually reserved for emphasizing and punctuating points in a song more in a different way than the [Whistle](#Whistle "wikilink") and [Finish](#Finish "wikilink"). Its default form and icon in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") is that of two hands clapping.

### Combo

The word "combo" has two meanings:

-   A set of [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") and [Sliders](Slider "wikilink") that come one after another, have the same colour and correspond to a specific part of a [beatmap's](#Beatmap "wikilink") song. The last object in each combo, if hit, provides the player with a boost to their [Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") if he also achieves a [Beat!](Score#Katu "wikilink") or an [Elite Beat!](Score#Geki "wikilink"). Every [Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink") is a combo by itself. Combos should be kept under approximately 20 [objects](#Object "wikilink"), and even lower than that the lower the difficulty is supposed to be.

<!-- -->

-   The number of objects a player has hit consecutively without [missing](#Miss "wikilink") or [sliderbreaking](#Sliderbreak "wikilink") once. The number is displayed at the bottom left of the playing field. Each [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), beginning and end of a [Slider](Slider "wikilink"), Slider Tick and [Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink") that the player hits without missing in between causes the Combo to increase by one. When the combo passes certain numbers, Combo Bursts appear and stars flash across the screen. A single miss causes the Combo to reset and Combo Fire to vanish. Combo provides a bonus multiplier to the score of everything the player hits except Slider Ticks, which are always worth 10 points each, and every level filled in the [Spinner Metre](#Spinner_Metre "wikilink") or Spinner bonus points, which is always worth 100 points and 1000 points each. Managing to finish a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") without missing once is called a [Full Combo](#Full_Combo "wikilink"), or FC. This is sometimes denoted by the phrase "Perfect!" on the results screen and will give an S [grade](#Grade "wikilink") or higher (unless the accuracy is low).

### Combo Colour

<img src="ComboColourDiffer.png" title="fig:Left side: the highlighted hitcircles&#39; color are both blue. Right side: the highlighted hitcircles&#39; colors are blue then red (at start of new combo)." alt="Left side: the highlighted hitcircles&#39; color are both blue. Right side: the highlighted hitcircles&#39; colors are blue then red (at start of new combo)." width="300" />To separate one [combo](#Combo "wikilink") from another, each combo has a colour, called **Combo Colour** (see image). So, when the colour of the hit-circle changed, you know you have changed combos. The colours keep repeating itself each 2 to 8 new combos.

One can change those colours and/or their order on the beatmap editor's Song Setup section (see [Beatmapping](Beatmapping "wikilink")), or in the skin being used, on the skin properties located on [Skin.ini](Skin.ini#.5BColours.5D "wikilink") (refer to section \[Colours\]).

### Deathstream

A particularly challenging, often extra long [stream](stream "wikilink") whose [objects](#Object "wikilink") follow each other in very rapid succession and/or in confusing patterns. This causes the player's stamina to run out very quickly. To be used in [beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") of a high difficulty level only.

### Difficulty stars

A visual representation of a [beatmap's](#Beatmap "wikilink") difficulty level, a rating between (theoretically) 0 and 10 stars according to an algorithm. [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") currently uses two different algorithms to calculate difficulty stars: [peppy's](peppy "wikilink"), which determines the bonus difficulty score multiplier, and eyup's, according to which the difficulty tags are assigned. There is also Echo49's algorithm, which is not currently implemented. You can see a beatmap's difficulty stars when testing it in the [editor](editor "wikilink") or at its listing in the site.

### Difficulties

Beatmaps can have multiple difficulties, varying from "Easy" to "Expert". A [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") should generally have two to five versions of varying difficulty, so that both novice and experienced players can enjoy playing it. Some factors that affect a version's difficulty are the number of [objects](#Object "wikilink") in the beatmap, whether a main or background (harder to hear) rhythm is followed for object placement, the length of [combos](combos "wikilink"), the [Beat Spacing](#Beat_Spacing "wikilink") value, the [drain](#Drain "wikilink") rate, the accuracy limit the game requires to register a hit, the size of [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), etc. [Difficulty](Difficulty "wikilink") stars are one way to gauge a version's difficulty level. The [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") website sorts difficulty versions into the Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane and Expert categories, but users can give custom names to the difficulty versions of their beatmaps.

### Drain

The constant decrease in the [Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") throughout playing a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), except during [breaks](#Break "wikilink"). Beatmappers can adjust the drain rate of their beatmaps in the Difficulty tab of the [Song Setup](Song_Setup "wikilink") dialog box in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink"). The higher the drain, the more difficult the beatmap is to [pass](#pass "wikilink"). Drain is the main reason that [Combos](Combos "wikilink") must not be designed too long, in order to provide a good player with Life Bar boosts frequently enough to counteract it.

### DS

DS to skrót od Distance Snapping (Odległość pomiędzy obiektami). Termin głównie używany przez mapperów i osoby modujące.

### DS games

Zbiorowy termin dla [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu%21_Tatakae%21_Ouendan) (również nazywanego Ouendan albo Ouendan 1), [Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moero%21_Nekketsu_Rhythm_Damashii_Osu%21_Tatakae%21_Ouendan_2) (zazwyczaj nazywanego Ouendan 2) oraz [Elite Beat Agents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Beat_Agents) (również nazywanego EBA). Są to gry rytmiczne wyprodukowane przez iNIS na konsolę Nintendo DS, na których podstawie bazowane jest [osu!](#osu! "wikilink").

E

### EBA

1) Skrót od Elite Beat Agents, jednej z [gier na konsolę DS](#DS_games "wikilink") na której jest bazowane osu!
2) Termin określający postacie z gry Elite Beat Agents czyli "The EBA" albo "The Agents".

### Etna Slider

Short, straight [Sliders](Slider "wikilink") that are usually half a [beat](#Beat "wikilink") long and separated by another half a beat. Etna Sliders are typically found in streams of 6 to 8 Sliders at a time. While Etna Sliders do not feature [Repeats](Repeats "wikilink"), the final slider of a [stream](stream "wikilink") may contain one such Repeat. The term originates in [this beatmap](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=655), coined by [this post](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5783#p5783), where such sliders fall at a point where the background video heavily features the Disgaea character [Etna](http://disgaea.wikia.com/wiki/Etna). This term was the inspiration for the creation of the Glossary.

### Extended Chat

A mode, activating by pressing F9 in [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") where the Chat window is expanded with a list of user panels, sortable by various attributes. Only the users currently using [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") are displayed, not ones who are participating in chat from [IRC](IRC "wikilink"). The user panels supply lots of information on each user if the mouse cursor is placed on them. The colour of the user panels indicates the user's current activity:
Dark Blue: Idle.
Grey: Playing a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). If you have the exact same beatmap, you can click on that panel to [spectate](#Spectate "wikilink") the player.
Light Blue: Spectating another player or viewing a replay.
Red: Editing one of one's own beatmaps.
Green: [Modding](Modding "wikilink") a beatmap, i.e. looking at it in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink").
Purple: Testing a beatmap from the Editor.
Brown: In the [multiplayer](multiplayer "wikilink") lobby or in a multiplayer room.
Gold: Playing in a multiplayer match.
Black: Away from keyboard (took no action during at least the last 2.5 minutes)
Light Green: Submitting a beatmap via the [BSS](#BBS "wikilink").

### Finish

A sound effect, part of a [sample set](#Sample_Set "wikilink"), usually reserved for emphasizing and punctuating points in a song more emphatically than the [Whistle](#Whistle "wikilink"). Its default form and icon in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") is that of a cymbal clash.

### Full Combo

Skrót: "FC". Oznacza ukończenie [beatmapy](PL:Beatmap "wikilink") z maksymalnym [combo](PL:Combo "wikilink") albo ukończenie [beatmapy](PL:Beatmap "wikilink") bez żadnych [missów](#Miss "wikilink") czy [sliderbreaków](#Sliderbreak "wikilink"). Full Combo zazwyczaj daje największy [wynik](PL:Score "wikilink") w trybach [osu!standard](osu!standard "wikilink") oraz [Catch The Beat](PL:Catch_the_Beat "wikilink").

### Full Submission

A way to submit a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") through the [BSS](#BSS "wikilink") system, making it available to the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community. Full Submission should be selected when the [mapper](mapper "wikilink") has added or removed images, background video or [sample sets](#Sample_Set "wikilink"). In all other cases, [Standard Submission](Submission "wikilink") is preferrable.

### GD

A *guest difficulty* ("GD" for short) is a contribution from one [mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") to another mapper's mapset.

Etiquette in the community can make it difficult for multiple mappers to upload [maps](Beatmap "wikilink") of the same song around the same time, so a different mapper interested in mapping that song may choose to contribute a [difficulty](difficulty "wikilink") to the other mapper's set instead. They might also decide 'after the fact' upon playing the other map that they like the music and want to create a difficulty for it. Or alternatively, they don't want to put in the effort involved in creating many difficulties on their own, so they just create one and give it to another mapper.

Sometimes, a mapset's owner might request guest difficulties for their mapset, either to make it feel like more of a community effort or because they don't want to create that many difficulties themselves. GDs are often requested by private messages in game or via forum private messages. GDs can also be requested in the modding queues; specifically queues that are offering to do them.

More than one guest mapper is allowed to contribute to a mapset, including mappers from any one of the four gamemodes. If an additional gamemode is to be featured in a mapset, that gamemode must have at least two difficulties that follows the ranking criteria. Each guest mapper is also allowed to create more than one difficulty to contribute to the mapset, as long as the mapset follows the ranking criteria in which the number of difficulties created by the guest mapper does not exceed the number of difficulties of the uploader.

### Grade

Also referred to as Rank, but renamed here to prevent confusion with other terms sharing that name. A letter that evaluates a player's performance when playing a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). It accompanies the total score at the Result Screen and appears in all lists where scores appear. From lowest to highest, grades are D, C, B, A, S, and SS. In order to achieve an S, one should not make any [misses](#Miss "wikilink") when playing the beatmap and have at most a ratio of 1:10 of [100s](Score#100 "wikilink") to [300s](Score#300 "wikilink"). In order to achieve an SS, one must only score 300s. There are also the SH and SSH grades, which are, respectively, an S and SS grade achieved when playing with the [Hidden](Hidden "wikilink") [mod](Game_Modifiers "wikilink") enabled.

### Grid Snapping

A button on the right side of the [editor](editor "wikilink") screen that forces every [object](#Object "wikilink") the [mapper](mapper "wikilink") places to fall on an intersection in a grid whose level of sparseness can be adjusted. Grid Snapping can help with aligning objects to each other and arranging them in patterns.

### Graveyard

The [Beatmap Graveyard](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=19). [Beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") which haven't had any activity for one month are moved to this sub-forum to keep the other beatmap sub-forums from being cluttered. One can "resurrect" their beatmap from the Graveyard by starting to work on it again and notifying a moderator.

### Graveyarded Beatmap

**Mapy o statusie Graveyarded** to mapy, które nie zostały zaktualizowane przez co najmniej 4 tygodnie. Takie mapy nie mogą być mapami [rankingowymi](PL:Ranked_beatmap "wikilink"), dopóki [mapper](PL:Mapper "wikilink") nie wskrzesi ich z "cmentarzyska" za pomocą linku "Revive Beatmap" w jego profilu pod kategorią '[Beatmaps](PL:Beatmapa "wikilink")'. Mapy o statusie 'graveyarded', tak samo jak mapy '[pending](PL:Pending_Beatmap "wikilink")' czy 'WiP', nie liczą się do statystyk gracza. ([Osiągnięcia](PL:Achievements "wikilink"), Celność, Punkty, etc).

### Hit Circle

  
*See also, [Hit Objects](Hit_Objects "wikilink").*

Called Hit Marker in the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink"). One of three [objects](#Object "wikilink") the player interacts with (the other two being the [Slider](Slider "wikilink") and the [Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink")) and probably the one most commonly seen. It's a coloured circle with a number on it (depending on its place in a [Combo](#Combo "wikilink")) with the outline of another circle ([Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink")) shrinking around it. Once the Approach Circle outline overlaps the Hit Circle's border, the player should [Tap](#Tap "wikilink") the Hit Circle, earning a number of points (50, 100 or 300) depending on how accurate their tapping was, and possibly scoring a [Beat!](Score#Katu "wikilink") or an [Elite Beat!](Score#Elite_Beat! "wikilink") if the circle is the end of a combo. Tapping Hit Circles gives a very small boost to the [Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink").

### Hitsounds

**Hitsounds** are the sounds the game creates in response to user input when completing [hit objects](Hit_Objects "wikilink") in the game. This is in contrast to the underlying music and sounds created by the user interface.

Hitsounds are used to provide an auditory feedback mechanism to the player to help them judge their timing. This is complementary to [approach circles](approach_circle "wikilink") and [spacing](spacing "wikilink"), the visual mechanisms used to communicate timing information.

Instead of just one hitsound, there are many, such as Whistle and Clap. These are added to make the hitsounds sound more expressive and let the player feel more like they are part of the music. osu! provides a wide array of hitsounds (eight in the stable release, since upgraded to twelve), and allows the mapper to further add sixteen more (24 in the test build). Sliders also have ambient sound effects when they are being performed successfully, including a recurrent ticking sound which matches the beat.

The default osu! hitsounds can be gathered by downloading the template skin using the osu! updater. This is useful for mappers who want to create custom hitsound samples.

### Hold Slider

A very short [Slider](Slider "wikilink") that [repeats](repeats "wikilink") a number of times, which can be cleared by the player simply placing their cursor anywhere on it and holding the button instead of following a path, as is usually the case. Hold Sliders are usually used for rapid rhythm hits in a song and can be substituted by [stacked](#Stacked "wikilink") [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink").

I
-

### IRC

[osu!](#osu! "wikilink") chat is commonly referred to as IRC (Internet Relay Chat) as this is the protocol it uses. Because of this, you can use your favorite IRC client to connect to osu! chat without opening the game itself. Connect to <span style="text-decoration: underline">irc.ppy.sh</span> and you will auto-join the \#osu channel.

### iNiS

  
*[Artykuł Wikipedii (ang.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INiS)*

**iNiS** to japońska korporacja tworząca gry a zwłaszcza rytmiczne. Jest twórcą trzech [gier na konsolę DS](#DS_games "wikilink") na których jest bazowane [osu!](osu! "wikilink").

J
-

### Jump

To place a [hit circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") or a [slider](Slider "wikilink") that is close to another one of the timeline noticeably farther than [Beat Spacing](#Beat_Spacing "wikilink") would suggest, forcing the player to "jump" from one point of the screen to another to [tap](#Tap "wikilink") it on time. More apparent in early [beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") and even the first [Ouendan](#Ouendan "wikilink") game, Jumps can make a beatmap more fun and thrilling but should be used very rarely and only on high [difficulty](difficulty "wikilink") versions.

K
-

### Kiai

A term given to "special" [timing sections](#Timing_section "wikilink") to emphasize a part of a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). A player can tell if a part of a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") has a kiai timing section by seeing added visual effects such as flashing [beats](Hit_Objects "wikilink"), flying stars and fountains. Abuse of kiai can be disorienting, and thus [mappers](mappers "wikilink") are advised to use it judiciously.

### Kick Slider

Krótki [Slider](PL:Slider "wikilink") który gracz może ukończyć poprzez umieszczanie kursora na środku drogi slidera i trzymanie przycisku. Zobacz także [Etna Sliders](#Etna_Slider "wikilink").

### Kudosu

Kombinacja wyrazów "kudos" oraz "osu!". Jest to system oceniania który nagradza użytkowników któzy regularnie [modują](PL:Mod "wikilink"). Mapper może nagrodzić Kudosu osobę która napisała konstruktywny post o modowaniu jego mapy. Zgromadzone Kudosu może zwiększyć priorytet [beatmapy](#Beatmap "wikilink").

L
-

### Lead-in

A time period of silence, up to three seconds long, which can be inserted before the beginning of a [beatmap's](#Beatmap "wikilink") song. Particularly useful if the beatmapper has placed [objects](#Object "wikilink") right at, or very near to, the beginning of the song.

### Life Bar

Also variously called Health Bar, HP Bar, Spirit Bar or Ki Bar. A bar at the top left of the playing screen which has a symbol moving along it. If the bar empties completely, the player fails the current [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") (unless he has the Easy, Relax, Autopilot and/or No Fail [mods](mods "wikilink") enabled). The bar [drains](#Drain "wikilink") at a constant rate throughout the course of a beatmap, except during a [break](break "wikilink"). A sizeable part of the bar is also depleted in case of a [miss](#Miss "wikilink"). The bar is replenished by the player [Tapping](#Tap "wikilink") [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), following [Sliders](Slider "wikilink") and Slider Ticks, and spinning [Spinners](#Spinner "wikilink"). The more accurate the tapping, the bigger the boost. The player also receives larger boosts if he achieves a [Beat!](Score#Katu "wikilink") or an [Elite Beat!](#Geki "wikilink") at the end of a [combo](combo "wikilink").

### M4M

Mod For Mod, a term describing when a [Modder](#Modder "wikilink") agrees to mod another modder's map in return for a mod on their own map

### Mapper

Jest to osoba która tworzy [beatmapy](PL:Beatmaps "wikilink") w edytorze beatmap. Oznacza także twórcę beatmapy.

### [MAT](MAT "wikilink")

Short for the [Modding Assistance Team](Modding_Assistance_Team "wikilink"), a group of users experienced in [modding](modding "wikilink"). MAT members can mark [beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") they approve of with a [bubble](bubble "wikilink"), noting them as worthy of further consideration by the [BAT](BAT "wikilink").

As of the 23rd of April, 2013, all members of the Modding Assistance Team at that time were promoted as full members of the [BAT](BAT "wikilink"), with the MAT being decommissioned.

### Miss

Failing to [tap](#Tap "wikilink") a [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") on time by a large margin, not holding the cursor and/or pressing the button at one or more Slider Ticks, or failing to fill a [Spinner Metre](#Spinner_Metre "wikilink") within the allotted time. A miss causes a sizeable part of the [Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") to be depleted, prevents the player from getting an S, SS, SH or SSH [grade](#Grade "wikilink") and resets the [Combo](#Combo "wikilink"), lowering the potential maximum score that can be achieved. Misses in the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") are represented by a red X.

### Modder

A term given to osu! players that gives comments or suggestions on maps of other people at the beatmap editor.

Activities are shown either at [Works In Progress](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10) (including the [Modding Queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/60)) and/or [Pending Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/6).

N
-

### NC

i) New Combo, a modding term to suggest that a beat needs to be the start of a new combo.
ii) Nightcore mod, a variant of the double time mod that increases the pitch of the singers and adds a consistent bass drum to the music.

### NM

An NM is a term that stands for "Normal Mod." When a person wants a free mod from somewhere or just needs a mod any map they participated in, they may ask for one.

### Nuke

A [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") which, for various reasons, is currently extremely far from getting [ranked](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") and needs a particularly large number of modifications before it's even presentable. Examples include not following even the most basic of guidelines, such as having completely incorrect [timing](#Timing "wikilink") or objects placed at random on the grid and/or timeline, but also [extremely challenging](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=2305&hilit=max+forever) or unconventional beatmaps (e.g. consisting of [a single [Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink")](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1498&hilit=leva%27s+polka)). The warning icon that accompanies Nuked beatmaps is the symbol for radioactive materials.

### Object

Collective term for [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") [Sliders](Slider "wikilink") and [Spinners](#Spinner "wikilink"), the gameplay elements players of [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") and the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") that the player interacts with. Also called "hit objects" or "elements".

### Offset

The period of time between the beginning of a [beatmap’s](#Beatmap "wikilink") song file and the instant the first beat of the rhythm is heard, from which the position of the first [beat](#Beat "wikilink") is calculated. Measured in milliseconds (ms). Offset is one half of correct beatmap [timing](#Timing "wikilink"), the other half being [BPM](BPM "wikilink").

### osu!

i) A rhythm video game for Microsoft Windows, based on certain [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink"). Spelled with a lowercase "o" and an exclamation mark.
ii) [osu!Standard](http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Standard), the game mode that osu! was originally based on.
iii) An informal greeting in the Japanese language, resulting from condensing the phrase "**O**hayo gozaima**su**!" (Good morning!) Pronounced with a silent u ("OSS"). Close English equivalents include "Yo!" or "Hey!". Read more about its meaning in Japanese language and culture [here](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2686#p2686).

### osu!cookie

![Tak, to wielkie koło z napisem osu!](Intro_static.jpg "fig:Tak, to wielkie koło z napisem osu!") Inne słowo określające logo osu! pojawiające się wiele razy w kliencie. Możesz je zobaczyć w [głównym menu](PL:Interface#Main_Menu "wikilink"), [trybie Solo](Interface#Solo "wikilink"), oraz informacji o awarii (patrz tutaj [:File:Pippi corruption.jpg](:File:Pippi_corruption.jpg "wikilink"))

### osupixel

An **osupixel** represents one screen pixel when osu! is running in 640x480 resolution. osu!pixels are one of the main coordinate systems used in osu!, and apply to [hit object](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") placement and [storyboard](#Storyboard "wikilink") screen coordinates.

In contrast, textures are scaled such that one texture pixel ([texel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texel_%28graphics%29)) corresponds to one screen pixel at 1024x768 resolution.

### Ouendan

i) In Japanese culture, a cheer squad which, similar to western cheerleaders, rallies a sports team on using drums, horns, banners and yells of encouragement. ii) The pair of Japanese [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") osu! is based on. Also sometimes used to refer specifically to the first of these games. iii) A collective term for the playable characters in the aforementioned games, i.e. "The Ouendan".

### Overmapping

  
*Main articles: [Insane](Insane#Overmapping "wikilink") and [Music Theory](Music_Theory#Part_3:_Overmapping "wikilink")*

When the [beats](Hit_Objects "wikilink") or placement of beats is placed in a way that makes the difficulty of the map contrast the actual song. This can be done by adding unnecessary [jumps](jumps "wikilink") or slider [speed-ups](Slider_Velocity_Changes "wikilink"), or by mapping to an unknown beat in the music consistently, in order to add difficulty (ie. Adding notes on blue ticks when the song is only using red ticks).

### Public Build

A [Build](#Build "wikilink") updated every once in a while (rarely more frequently than a week), including all working changes introduced in [Test Builds](#Test_Build "wikilink") between the previous [Public Build](#Public_Build "wikilink") and this one. The Public Build [Updater](#Updater "wikilink") is what most [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") players use.

### Qualify

A [Beatmap](Beatmap "wikilink") is [Qualified](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist&s=4&r=11) if it has gone through extensive modding and the beatmap has been nominated for [Ranking](#Ranking "wikilink"), but have not been ranked yet. The QAT(short for Quality Assistance Team) is responsible for moving qualified beatmaps into the Ranked category, or Disqualifying(also known as DQ) the beatmap, resulting in the need for more modding.

### Rank

  
*For Ranked beatmaps see [Ranked beatmap](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink").*

i) Another word for a [grade](#Grade "wikilink").
ii) A player’s standing in the online leaderboard (a.k.a Player [Rankings](#Ranking "wikilink")).
iii) Verb, "to rank", i.e. to second another moderator’s nomination and include a submitted [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to the Ranked Beatmap list, making scores achieved by anyone playing it count towards each player’s Ranking. Getting their beatmaps ranked is a goal of every beatmapper.

### Ranking

Alternatively called Leaderboard. A list which sorts members of the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community according to certain criteria. Can also refer to one's position in such a list. osu! currently has three Rankings: i) Player Rankings: the Ranking most commonly referred to, this list sorts players depending on their Ranked Score. Ranked Score is the sum of the highest score a player has achieved in every [ranked](ranked "wikilink") [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") he has played. Only [scores](Score "wikilink") achieved after the beatmap is ranked are taken into account. Only one score from each beatmap (the highest) is taken into account, regardless of how many difficulty versions it has. ii) Beatmapper Rankings: This list sorts everyone who has created at least one ranked beatmap, depending on the weighted average of all the ratings given to their beatmaps by other players, multiplied by a bonus modifier that increases the more ranked beatmaps they have. iii) Moderator Rankings: This list sorts moderators depending on how many posts they have made in the Beatmap sub-forums, i.e. how much beatmap [modding](modding "wikilink") they are doing.

### Recalc

Recalculate [Slider](Slider "wikilink") Lengths. A command under the Timing header of the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") screen. Select it when a change in [BPM](BPM "wikilink") is made after Sliders have been placed. This command will try to automatically adjust the length of every Slider in the [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to the new BPM. After choosing this command, especially if a large change in BPM has been made, it is important to check every Slider and adjust its length manually where necessary.

### Resnap

A pair of commands under the [Timing](#Timing "wikilink") header of the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") screen, one of which applies to the entire [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") and the other to the current [timing section](#Timing_section "wikilink") (if the beatmap has only one timing section, both commands are the same). Select when there has been a change in [offset](#Offset "wikilink") and/or [BPM](BPM "wikilink") after [objects](#Object "wikilink") have been placed. This command will try to automatically reposition all objects on the timeline so that they fall on the closest [beat](#Beat "wikilink") division your [Snap Divisor](Beat_Snap_Divisor "wikilink") allows. After choosing this command, especially if a large change in BPM and/or offset has been made, it is important to check every object and adjust its position on the timeline manually where necessary.

### RSI

**R**epetitive **S**train **I**njury, a disorder that affects the musculoskeletal and nervous system of the body. It can be caused by repetitive tasks in awkward positions, including playing osu! for an extended amount of time.

### Sample Set

A collection of sound effects that are heard during gameplay. People can use custom sample sets for their [beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink"). Apart from the default sound made when [tapping](#Tap "wikilink") a [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), the most well known elements in a sample set are the [Whistle](#Whistle "wikilink") and the [Finish](#Finish "wikilink"). Other parts of a sample set include the Slider Tick sounds and the sound made when filling the [Spinner Metre](#Spinner_Metre "wikilink").

### Skin

A set of graphics and custom [sample sets](#Sample_Set "wikilink") that can be chosen to replace the default ones used by [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") in order to customise one's playing experience. Most of what you see and hear in osu! can be skinned. There is [a sub-forum dedicated to skins](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=15).

### Sliderbreak

The loss of [combo](#combo "wikilink") from not holding a slider long enough, going out of the slider circle or not hitting the beginning of the slider (but within the follow circle of the slider). This will give a score of 100 or 50 for the note, depending on how much slider ticks are missed. Unlike [Missing](#Miss "wikilink"), you can still achieve an "S" rank after sliderbreaking.

### Song packs

Collections of [ranked beatmaps](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") that can be downloaded by file sharing services. Most song packs are sets of beatmaps that were ranked during the same time period, but in other packs contain songs of a similar style or theme. You can find song packs [here](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1853).

### Spectate

"Spec" for short. To watch another playing a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") in real time (approx. 500 ms delay). To spectate, open [Extended Chat](#Extended_Chat "wikilink") mode and click on a grey user panel. You need to have a copy of the exact same beatmap the person you wish to spectate is playing.

### Spinner

One of three [objects](#Object "wikilink") the player interacts with (the other two being the [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") and the [Slider](Slider "wikilink")) and probably the one seen least often. A Spinner is a circle that takes up the entire height of the play area and has a [Spinner Metre](#Spinner_Metre "wikilink") on either side. A large circular outline similar to a [Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink") appears on the Spinner’s border and gradually converges on its centre. The player should hold the mouse button down and spin in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. As long as the mouse button is held down, the cursor is locked on the Spinner’s area, so the player need not worry about going outside it. The Spinner is cleared if all the levels of the Spinner Metre are filled before its Approach Circle reaches the centre. Depending on the difficulty settings of each [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), a different number of spins are required to fill each level of the Spinner Metre (worth 100 points). If the player fills the Spinner Metre before the Approach Circle reaches the Spinner’s centre, each additional spin before time runs out will award the player with 1000 bonus points (each receiving a bonus multiplier depending on the player’s current [Combo](Combo "wikilink")). Spinning a Spinner provides a continuous minor boost to the [Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") depending on the spinning speed.

### Spinner Metre

A pair of bars on either side of a [Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink") which typically gradually fill up with colour as the player spins the Spinner. In order to clear the spinner, all levels of the Spinner Metre should light up before the [Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink") reaches the Spinner's centre. Each level that lights up on the Spinner Metre awards the player with 100 points (regardless of [Combo](#Combo "wikilink")).

### Spinner Spam

To overuse [Spinners](#Spinner "wikilink") in a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). There are many kinds of Spinner Spam: Using very long Spinners (lasting more than 10 seconds or so), using a lot of very short Spinners (lasting less than 2 seconds or so) one after the other, or even worse, using a lot of regular sized or long Spinners one after the other. With the possible exception of some especially challenging beatmaps, Spinner Spam is to be avoided for the following reasons: i) A Spinner is by far the gameplay element that causes the player the most fatigue, since it requires rapid, repetitive, vigorous motion. A lot of Spinners or even a single long one can easily tire a player’s arm. ii) Due to the circular, often frantic motion required to clear it, after clearing a spinner the player’s cursor is often left at a random position in the screen, possibly far from an incoming [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") or [Slider](Slider "wikilink"). A multitude of Spinners will thus be particularly disorienting for most players.

### Stacked

[Objects](#Object "wikilink") that overlap each other in the play field. Most common in [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), less common with Hit Circles and the edges of [sliders](Slider "wikilink") to be avoided with any other combination of objects. Stacking Hit Circles, while a clear violation of [Beat Spacing](#Beat_Spacing "wikilink"), is nevertheless permitted if the Hit Circles are very close to each other in the timeline (half a [beat](#Beat "wikilink") or usually even less).

### Standard Submission

A way to submit a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") through the [BSS](#BSS "wikilink") system, making it available to the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community. Standard Submission is the one used when first uploading a beatmap, as well as when updating with changes such as [object](#Object "wikilink") placement, tweaks in [timing](#Timing "wikilink"), custom colour schemes, new difficulty versions etc. Every Standard Submission of a beatmap after the first is faster because only the changes are uploaded.

### Star

i) A stage in a beatmap’s [modding](Modding "wikilink") process where a moderator judges a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to be on the right track but needing some improvements before he approves of it with a [bubble](bubble "wikilink"). Examples include adjustments in [timing](#Timing "wikilink"), incorrect [Beat Spacing](#Beat_Spacing "wikilink") in some areas, or creating additional difficulty versions. Beatmaps receiving a star are denoted by a star graphic next to their thread’s title. A star may be removed by another mod if he judges the beatmap to need a rather larger amount of improvements than expected.
ii) Can be used as a shortened form of [difficulty](Difficulty "wikilink") stars.

### Star Priority

**Star Priority** is a method of helping [BNs](BN "wikilink") find beatmaps worthy of [bubbling](Beatmap_approval#Bubble "wikilink") and later [ranking](Beatmap_approval#Ranked "wikilink"). The Star Priority of a beatmap is determined by how many [mod posts](Modding "wikilink") that have gained kudosu in the beatmap's thread, the sum of kudosu stars the map set has received. A kudosu star can be given by any user to any map, though shooting a kudosu star comes at the price of one [kudosu](kudosu "wikilink"). The conversion rate was formerly three kudosu for one kudosu star that increased the Star Priority by two.

The higher the star priority, the higher the beatmap's thread appears in the Works in Progress or Pending subforum. At least 12 star priority is needed for a map to be bubbled or ranked.

### Storyboard

A set of still images, animated images and sound effects that tells a story during a [beatmap|beatmap’s](#Beatmap "wikilink") course but especially before the beatmap’s beginning, during [breaks](#Break "wikilink") and after the beatmap’s end. In the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink"), Storyboards concern one or more persons facing a difficult challenge or predicament which they then try to overcome whilst being cheered on by the player-controlled characters to the tune of a song. Therefore, a Storyboard can take various directions depending on the player’s performance. [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") storyboarding is supported through the use of a scripting language or the [Storyboard Editor](Storyboard_Editor "wikilink") which can be accessed in [Editor](Editor "wikilink") Mode under "Design". There is [a sub-forum dedicated to Storyboards](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=20).

### Storyboard Editor

Can be found under "Design" in [Editor](Editor "wikilink") mode. As the name implies, [storyboards](Storyboarding "wikilink") can be easily created and edited here.

### Stream

A long series of [objects](#Object "wikilink"), not necessarily belonging in a single [Combo](Combo "wikilink"), which appear in rapid succession. Also see [Deathstream](#Deathstream "wikilink").

### SV

Slider Velocity, szybkość z jaką porusza się slider w stosunku do BPM.

### TAG2/TAG3/TAG4

Tag difficulties are difficulties that are designed for tag cooperation in multi-play mode. Since each player is responsible for one combo in one turn only, each combo can be separated extremely far, making it nearly impossible to play by a single player, and therefore it becomes a challenge for elite players in terms of precision of jumping. [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/87570&m=0 Example](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/87570&m=0_Example "wikilink")

TAG difficulties are usually named TAG in a beatmap set. TAG2 maps are meant for 2 players while TAG4 maps (the hardest) are meant for 4 players.

Note that tag difficulties are unrankable because they are far too hard to be ranked and are not designed for a single player.

### Tablet

A graphics tablet, an alternative input medium to the computer mouse. A tablet consists of a flat surface on which one can point and drag using an attached stylus. The image of the screen does not appear on the tablet, thus making it different in functionality from a [Touch screen](#Touch_screen "wikilink").

### Tap

To press a button while the cursor is over a [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"). Tapping Hit Circles at the right moment, as indicated by the [beatmap’s](#Beatmap "wikilink") music and the [Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink"), is an essential part of [osu](osu "wikilink")! gameplay. There are many buttons one can use to tap: either mouse button, the z and x keys on the keyboard (see [z/x](#z/x "wikilink")), either button on a [Touchpad](#Touchpad "wikilink"), buttons on a [Tablet’s](#Tablet "wikilink") pen, etc.

### Test Build

A [Build](#Build "wikilink") usually updated at least daily with up-to-date improvements in the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") application. Its [Updater](#Updater "wikilink") is available to moderators and other willing beta testers upon request. All working changes in the Test Builds are eventually made available in a new version of the [Public Build](#Public_Build "wikilink").

### Test Mode

Funkcja edytora beatmap umożliwiająca zagranie [beatmapy](#Beatmap "wikilink") (wynik nie zostanie zapisany).

### Time signature

A musical term indicating how many [beats](#Beat "wikilink") are in each measure and what note value constitutes a single beat. [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") offers two alternative time signatures, which can be selected from the [Timing](#Timing "wikilink") menu: 4/4, which is the one most commonly used, and 3/4, which is selected when the rhythm of the song is of, or similar to, a waltz.

### Timing

Probably the most important requirement for a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to get [ranked](ranked "wikilink"), as well as the most difficult to accomplish. Timing a beatmap consists of determining the [offset](#Offset "wikilink") and then the [BPM](BPM "wikilink") of the song it uses. On songs where the tempo changes, this needs to be done for every [timing section](#Timing_section "wikilink"). The timing process creates the timeline on which [objects](#Object "wikilink") will be placed. Without perfect timing, or at least close enough that the human ear can't tell the difference, it is next to impossible to place objects to the rhythm of the music, which is the entire point of [osu!](#osu! "wikilink")

### Timing section

A part of a song which follows a different rhythm than the parts preceding and following it. Many songs have a constant tempo and thus a single timing section, but for those which have more, the beatmapper needs to identify any areas where the song [BPM](BPM "wikilink") and/ or [time signature](#Time_Signature "wikilink") changes and find the [timing](#Timing "wikilink") for each one. Timing sections can also be used even if the rhythm of the song remains constant throughout the beatmap, for example in order to allow the beatmapper to assign different [sample sets](#Sample_Set "wikilink") to different parts of the song. Those are called "inherited timing sections" and are identified by green lines.

### Touch screen

One of the input mediums used by the Nintendo DS and the sole input medium for the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") is based on. Osu! supports Touch screen functionality, but the hardware required is generally expensive for the average player. A computer whose entire screen functions as a Touch screen is called a Tablet PC (Do not confuse with [Tablet](#Tablet "wikilink")).

### Touchpad

A substitute for the computer mouse found on laptop computers. A small rectangular area on which one can drag one’s finger to move the mouse cursor. Due to the way touchpads are designed, they do not work with a stylus or similar devices.

U

### Universal Offset

The time delay between a) the [object](#Object "wikilink") graphics and [sample set](#Sample_Set "wikilink") sounds associated with them and b) the point of the song where they should be heard. Universal Offset applies to all songs used in [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") and its value differs according to each system's specifications. After being determined, it doesn't need to be modified again. Incorrectly set Universal Offset causes [timing](#Timing "wikilink") problems in every [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") played or edited. If everything sounds off to you while playing a [ranked](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), try checking your Universal Offset. Universal Offset is set from the Options Menu.

### Updater

The osume.exe file, which, when run, will check whether there have been updates to the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") [build](#Build "wikilink") you are using and download and install any such updates. There are two Updaters - one for the [Public Build](#Public_Build "wikilink") and one for the [Test Build](#Test_Build "wikilink").

### upppy

A fast and easy-to-use uploading service coded by [peppy](peppy "wikilink"). If you want to share a file with the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community, forget about depositing it on Rapidshare, Megaupload, ImageShack and the like - put it on upppy and everyone's happy! :) You can find it [here](http://up.ppy.sh).

### Whistle

A sound effect, part of a [sample set](#Sample_Set "wikilink"), usually reserved for emphasizing and punctuating certain points in a song. Its default form and icon in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") is that of a blown whistle.

### WIP

Acronym for Work In Progress, a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") that is, for one reason or another, deemed incomplete by its creator (e.g. incomplete difficulty versions, only one difficulty version, pending correction or suggestions on the timing etc.) WIPs can be submitted through the [BSS](#BSS "wikilink") to the Beatmap Help forum to get comments, feedback and help from [mods](Modding "wikilink") and other users.

### z/x

Klawisze klawiatury z i x są używane do grania w [osu!](#osu! "wikilink"). Jest to bardzo popularna alternatywa dla przycisków myszy. Podczas rozgrywki, gdy "z" zostanie wciśnięte, lewy przycisk myszy nie zadziała oraz wice wersa. To samo dotyczy klawisza "x" oraz prawego przycisku myszy. Klawisze te mogą zostać zmienione w opcjach.
