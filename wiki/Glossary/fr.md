# Glossaire

Pendant des années, la osu!community a adopté son propre verlan qui peut être déroutant pour les débutants.
Cette page est une compilation de la plupart de ces termes.
Les ajouts et modifications sont les bienvenus !

<!--Les liens préfixés par le symbole "#" sont aussi des termes de ce glossaire, tandis que les liens bleus pointent vers d'autres articles.-->

## A

### Abandoned wasteland -- TODO

If the name isn't obvious enough, the abandoned wasteland is a hidden sub-forum where the instructions to the moderators concerning it will: "Put stuff we don't really need in here."
When a thread is "wastelanded", it is moved there.

### AFK

AFK est un acronyme anglais qui signifie "Away From Keyboard" (littéralement : "loin du clavier").
Par exemple quand un utilisateur part faire quelque chose d'autre, alors qu'il est encore connecté.
osu! désigne les joueurs inactifs depuis un certain temps avec la mention "Idle".

### Cercle d'approche

Dans le mode de jeu [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!/), le cercle d'approche est le cercle extérieur qui entoure le cercle de frappe, le debut d'un slider, ou le centre d'un spinner.
Quand le cercle d'approche touche la bordure extèrieure du cercle de frappe ou du spinner, vous devez cliquer.
Pour les spinners, le cercle d'approche indiquera la durée de ce spinner.

### Authentique (terme original : Authentic)

Authentique est un terme qui désigne une beatmap qui reprend tous les aspects d'un niveau spécifique des jeux DS originaux (chanson, paramètres, placement des objets, etc.).

## B

### Bancho

Bancho est le serveur "aisément expensible" codé par peppy.
Il supplante le besoin d'un serveur IRC tiers pour le management du contenu online d'osu!.
Les joueurs se connectent automatiquement à Bancho quand ils démarrent osu!, et ce si ils sont connectés à internet

### BAT

**Au 1° février 2015, le BAT a été renommé le Beatmap Nomination Group**

BAT&mdash;acronyme pour Beatmap Appreciation Team&mdash;était un groupe d'utilisateurs qui se chargeaient d'approuver et de ranker vos beatmaps .

### Pulsation (terme original : Beat)

La pulsation est un terme qui s'applique à la timeline dans le mode édition.
La pulsation est une période de temps en lesquelles les chansons peuvent être divisées en fonction de leur BPM.
Une beatmap bien timée aura toutes les pulsations qui correspondront au rythme de la musique, et une pulsation entière devra tomber entre deux lignes blanches sur la timeline.
Dépendamment de la division appliquée, d'autres lignes de division de la pulsation peuvent être visibles:

- lignes rouges pour les demi-pulsations,
- lignes bleues pour les quarts de pulsations,
- lignes jaunes pour les huitièmes de pulsations, et
- lignes violettes pour les tiers et sixièmes de pulsations

### Packs de beatmap (terme original : beatmap pack)

Les Beatmap packs _(si le nom est ambïgu pour vous)_ sont des packs de beatmap.
Les packs de beatmap sont des ensembles de beatmaps rankées et / ou approuvées qui peuvent être téléchargés depuis un service de partage de fichiers (comme [osu!Mirror](https://osu.yas-online.net/) ou [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/)).

La grande majorité des packs sont des ensembles de beatmaps rankées durant la même ppériode de temps. Cependant, certains peuvent contenir des chansons de thème ou de style similaires.

Pour voir la liste des packs, consultez le [Listing des packs de beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist)

### Espacement des pulsations (terme original : Beat spacing)

L'espacement des pulsations est un preincipe qui statue que l'espacement de chaque objet (excepté les spinners) doit être soit rapproché, si plaçés de manière proche dans la timeline, soit éloigné, si plaçés de manière éloignées dans la timeline.
De manière simplifiée, proche dans le temps = proche dans l'espace et loin dans le temps = loin dans l'espace.

Votre espacement des pulsations joue un rôle crucial lorsque le joueur joue à votre beatmap !
Un espacement constant des pulsations est une condition de base pour ranker votre beatmap, car il procure au joueur une expérience plus intuitive qui lui permet d'apprendre comment bouger son curseur sur l'écran à vitesse constante.

Placer un objet plus proche que l'espacement de pulsation peut tromper le joueur et le faire cliquer sur ces éléments trop tôt.
D'autre part, le placer trop loin peut forcer le joueur à bouger son curseur à travers l'écran pour cliquer dessus dans les temps.
Une exception commune pour l'espacement des pulsations sont les cercles de frappe superposés.

Pour assurer un espacement constant, activez le bouton `Distance Snap` sur le côté droit de l'éditeur.
Vous pouvez choisir une valeur d'espacement en maintenant `ALT` et en slidant le sélecteur situé en haut à droite jusqu'a ce que vous atteignez la valeur désirée.
Note that the higher the value would allow a more difficult beatmap.

### Beatmap

A beatmap (also known as a level or a map) is where the majority of osu! lies.
It is quite like the stages in the DS games.
At their most basic form, beatmaps have a song, hitcircles, sliders, and/or spinners placed based on the rhythm of the music.
Nowadays, beatmaps may also have a background image or video, or even a storyboard.

For more details about how beatmaps are uploaded, see BSS.

### Beatmapper

A beatmapper (or mapper) refers to the osu!user who uses the editor to create a beatmap.

### Beatmapset

A beatmapset (or mapset) is the collection of beatmaps that are packaged inside the `OSZ` file, under the same beatmapper.
Beatmapsets will always have the same music/sound, video, if any.
However, do note that some beatmaps from a beatmapset may specifically contain a certain background image or storyboard that is separate from the others.

### BG

BG is short for background.
BG refers to the background image and/or video of a beatmap.
Inside a beatmap folder, "BG" is usually the name for the background image.

## BN

BN is short for Beatmap Nominator which is a group of osu!users who nominate pending beatmaps.
This group was once called the BAT (Beatmap Appreciation Team).

For details about Beatmap Nominators, see [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nomination_Group/).

### BPM

BPM is short for Beats Per Minute and represents the number of whole beats in a minute.

### Break

A break is when a section of a beatmap has no objects.
During this time, the drain in the life bar is temporarily halted.
Breaks usually allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their input device.

Depending on the settings, when a break is initated, letterboxes (the black horizontal bars on the top and bottom off the screen) may appear.
In addition to this, a passing or failing graphic and sound will appear and play to indicate if the player is doing well or not, if there is enough time.

### BSS

BSS is short for Beatmap Submission System.

When a beatmapper is finished mapping their beatmap and is ready to share their creation around the world, they must first submit it to the BSS.
When they do this, the BSS will automatically assign a forum thread and will generate a post with information about your beatmapset.
The forum thread it generates will help you get feedback from modders and other players who play your map.

## C

### Changelog

The changelog is a forum thread where peppy and the osu!dev team details their day-by-day improvements, additions and bug fixes.

To see the changelog, see [Recent Releases](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/changelog).

### Choke

A choke occurs when the player almosts obtains a full combo while playing a beatmap, but loses it near the end.

On the contrary, a reverse choke is when the player loses their combo at the beginning but obtains a full combo for the rest of the beatmap.

### Collab

Collab (or collaboration) has two meanings:

1. the work of multiple mappers mapping a single beatmap; usually a marathon beatmap
   - when collaborating on a beatmap, the creator must map a majority (at least half) of the beatmap
   - this is to ensure that the creator has done enough to upload the map under their username
2. the mapset containing guest difficulties

Collab may sometimes be used in difficulty version names.

### Combo

Combo has two meanings:

1. a set of hitcircles and sliders that comes one after another (also called a comboset)
2. the number representing the number of objects a player has hit consecutively without missing or sliderbreaking once
   - this number is displayed in various places:
     - bottom-left for osu!standard
     - on the drums in osu!taiko
     - above the fruit catcher in osu!catch
     - centre of the stage in osu!mania (vertical height varies by skin)

### Comboburst

The comboburst is a collection of skinned elements/images that will _burst_ out from the left or right of the screen (or the right side of the osu!mania stage) after obtaining a combo of 30, 60, 100, (multiples of 50, after 100).

### Combo colour

The combo colour is a colour that that separates one combo from another.

In osu!standard, all combos have a colour.
A new combo is started when the colour of the hitobject changes.
The colours will keep repeating themselves depending on how many the mapper defined (or how many your skin's skin.ini file defines).
There is a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 combo colours.

In osu!catch, each object is coloured in the order given.
Droplets and end-slider fruit will always have the same colour as the start-fruit.
However, bananas will always have a tint of yellow.

When editing a beatmap, one can change those colours and/or their order in the Song Setup section.

For skins, the skin properties for the combo colours is located on in the `[Colours]` section of the skin.ini.
However, do note that the skin's defined combo colours is only used when the mapper does **not** define them.

### Combo fire

![R.I.P. combo fire](img/combo-fire.jpg)

The combo fire was a feature in osu! that would display a burning yellow flame after obtaining a combo of 30.
If the player obtains a combo of 500, the combo fire colour will change from yellow to blue.
The combo fire will extinguish itself if the combo was broken but would still be reobtainable.

This feature was later disabled due to performance concerns.

### Cookie

![](img/Intro_static.jpg "The cookie is typically used to describe the circular osu!logo which appears at the very start of the game, and refers to its shape.")

The cookie, is another word for "osu!logo" which has appeared many times in the osu!client.
The cookie is seen in the main menu, in solo mode, and previously in old crash reports (seen [here](img/Pippi_corruption.jpg)).

## D

### Deathstreams

A deathstream is a very long stream whose objects follow each other in a very rapid succession and/or in confusing patterns.
These usually causes the player to lose their stamina very quickly and potentially fail the beatmap.

It is heavily suggested to only use deathstreams when a beatmap hints it and/or has a high BPM.
This should **not** be used to overmap!

### Difficulty stars

The difficulty stars is the visual representation of a beatmap's difficulty.
This rating is (theoretically) between 0 and 10 stars based off of an algorithm.

osu! currently uses two different algorithms to calculate difficulty stars:

- peppy's algorithm
  - determined by using the bonus difficulty score multiplier and eyup's algorithm (use the difficulty tags are assigned)
- Echo's algorithm (not in use)

You can see a beatmap's difficulty stars when testing it in the editor, on the song selection screen, or at its listing in the site.

### Difficulties

Beatmaps can have multiple difficulties, or diffs for short (or diff for singular), varying from Easy to Expert and above.
A beatmap should generally have two to five versions of varying difficulty.
This would allow both novices and experienced players to be able to enjoy playing it.

Some factors that can affect a version's difficulty are the number of object in the beatmap, whether a main or background (harder to hear) rhythm is followed for object placement, the length of combos, the beat spacing value, the drain rate, the accuracy limit the game requires to register a hit, the size of hitcircle, etc..
Difficulty stars are one way to gauge a version's difficulty level.
The osu!website sorts difficulty versions into into 5 categories:

- Easy,
- Normal,
- Hard,
- Insane, and
- Expert

### Drain time

The drain time, or drain, refers to the total duration of the beatmap that requires the player to be active.
Drain time does not consider the breaks and unmapped parts throughout the beatmap.

Maps with very long drain times are typically referred to as "marathon" maps and require endurance beyond the norm in order to complete successfully.

### Drop

A drop is an osu!catch element that gives a score of 100.
A drop is the equivalent to the osu!standard's slider tick.

The difference between drops and droplets is that a drop is twice as big as droplets are.

### Droplet

A droplet is an osu!catch element that gives a score of 10.
A droplet is the equivalent to the osu!standard's slider track.

The difference between drops and droplets is that a droplet is half as big as drops are.

### DS

DS is an abbreviation meaning distance snapping.
This term is usually seen during the modding process.

### DS games

Collective term for [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan) (also called "Ouendan" or "Ouendan 1"), [Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moero!_Nekketsu_Rhythm_Damashii_Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan!_2) (almost always called "Ouendan 2") and [Elite Beat Agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Beat_Agents) (also called "EBA").
A set of rhythm games, developed by [iNiS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INiS) for the Nintendo DS handheld video game system, which share a lot of gameplay and presentation elements.
osu! is mostly based on these games.

## E

### EBA

EBA has two meanings:

- Elite Beat Agents, one of the DS games which osu! is based on
- the collective term for the playable characters in that game (referring to meaning above), i.e. "The EBA" or "The Agents"

### Extended chat

The Extended chat can be activated by pressing `F9` in osu! where the chat window is expanded with a list of user panels.
These panels are sortable by various attributes.
Users that are using the osu!client are displayed, not ones that are participating in chat from using a IRC client.
The user panels supply lots of information on each user.
If the mouse cursor is placed on them.
The colour of the user panels indicates the user's current activity; an explaination for these codes, see [Chat Console](/wiki/Chat_Console/).

## F

### Fail

Fail has three meanings:

- the incompletion of a beatmap due to low health
- in multiplayer, an indicator underneath the player's name to show they have failed the beatmap
- the player having less than 50% health during a break; where an indicator will display if you failed the section

### FC

![](img/CombosCanHurt.png)

The score on the top has a full combo, while the one on the bottom has a broken combo.
Losing your combo halfway through the game could easily lose you half as many points!

FC or, a "full combo", is when a player completes a beatmap while obtaining the maximum combo possible.
This does not account accuracy as it is often used to mean clearing a beatmap without having any misses or sliderbreaks.

Full combos usually give the most score in the osu!standard and osu!catch modes.

## G

### Geki

Geki, or Elite Beat!, is a scoring term used when you complete a combo with the highest accuracy on every note.
Many geki will happen during the course of a successful play.

### Guest difficulty

Guest difficulty, or GD, refers to any difficulty made by a mapper for inclusion in another mapper's set.
Guest difficulties usually have the mapper's username as the difficulty's name.

There are many reasons for guest difficulties to exist:

- etiquette in the community can make it difficult for multiple mappers to upload beatmaps of the same song around the same time
  - a different mapper, interested in mapping that song, may choose to contribute a difficulty to the other mapper's set instead
- they may also decide, after-the-fact, upon playing the other map that they like the music and want to create a difficulty for it
- or the mapper doesn't want to put in the effort in creating the difficulties on their own, but rather would want to just create one and give it to another mapper

On the other hand, it may be the creator who wants a few guest difficulties:

- this&mdash;usually&mdash;is to give the mapset a "community effort" feel
- or, simply, they don't want to create such difficulties by themselves

Guest difficulties are often requested by private messages in-game or via forum private messages.
Guest difficulties can also be requested in the modding queues, especially those who are offering to do them.

More than one guest mapper is allowed to contribute to a beatmapset, including beatmappers from any one of the four gamemodes.
If an additional gamemode is to be featured in a mapset, that gamemode must have at least two difficulties that follows the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/).
Each guest beatmapper is also allowed to create more than one difficulty to contribute to the mapset, as long as the number of difficulty versions created by the guest mapper does not exceed the number of difficulty versions of the creator/uploader (this is to determine who should upload the mapset).

### Grade

A grade, usually confused with rank is a term created to prevent confusion with other terms sharing that name.
A grade is a letter-grade that repersents the player's performance when playing a beatmap.
It accompanies the total score at the result screen and appears in all lists where scores appear.
From lowest to highest, the possible grades are D, C, B, A, S, Silver S, SS, and Silver SS.

In order to achieve an S, one should not miss when playing the beatmap and have at most a ratio of 1:10 of 100s to 300s.
In order to achieve an SS, one must only score 300s.
There are also the Silver S and Silver SS grades, which are, respectively, an S and SS grade achieved when playing with the Hidden and/or Flashlight mod enabled

### Grid snapping

Grid snapping refers to a same-named button on the right hand side of the editor screen.

Enabling it will force every newly placed (or existing, but moved) object to snap along the intersections of the grid.

The base level of spacing between each sector of the grid can be adjusted by pressing `G` or by going to `View` then `Grid Level`.
Grid snapping can help with aligning objects to each other and arranging them in patterns.

### Graveyard

The beatmap graveyard is a collection of beatmaps that haven't had any activity for one month (4 weeks or more).
They are automatically moved to this sub-forum to prevent the active beatmaps' sub-forum from being cluttered.

A beatmapper whose beatmap is in the graveyard can resurrect their beatmap from the graveyard by:

1. going to your profile,
2. click the `Beatmaps` tab,
3. click the `Graveyarded Beatmaps` tab, and
4. click the `Resurrect` link

This will allow you to update the beatmap through the BSS.

## H

### Hitsound

Hitsounds are the sounds that osu! plays in response to user input when completing one of the hitobjects in the game.
This is in contrast to the underlying music and sounds created by the user interface.

Hitsounds are used to provide an auditory feedback mechanism to the player to help them judge their timing.
These are complementary to approach circles and spacing which are the visual mechanisms used to communicate timing information.

There are 4 types of hitsounds:

- _(normal)_ (used when there is none of the below are used)
- whistle
- clap
- finish

These are added to make the hitsounds sound more expressive and let the player feel more like they are part of the music.
osu! provides a wide array of hitsounds (eight in the stable release, since upgraded to twelve).
Though, mappers can go further add up to 24 more.
Sliders also have ambient sound effects when they are being performed successfully, including a recurrent ticking sound which matches the beat.

For a list of skinnable hitsounds, see [Skinning Sounds](/wiki/Skinning/Sounds/).

## I

### Ignore list

The ignore list is a blacklist of words (or users) that the player does not want to be displayed in the osu!chat.

### IRC

IRC is an abbreviation for Internet Relay Chat.

For more information about IRC, see [Internet Relay Chat](/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat/).

## J

### Jump

A jump is an osu!standard and osu!catch mapping technique that requires hitobjects to be placed farther than they would be with the distance snapping.

More apparent, in early beatmaps and even the first Ouendan games, jumps can make a beatmap more fun and thrilling... though they should be used very rarely and only on harder difficulty versions.

In osu!catch, a jump would require two hitobjects to be placed farther apart vertically.
If a jump is too wide, a hyperdash may be used to prevent impossible jumps, thus making your map, at least, rankable.

## K

### Katu

Katu, or beat, is when you complete a particular combo without achieving the highest level of accuracy throughout that set.

This is different than a Geki because the comboset wasn't done perfectly with 300s.

### Keys

In osu!mania, the number of keys can determine the map's difficulty.
The more keys you have, the more the player has to focus for each key column.

### Kiai

Kiai is a term given for a "special" timing section to help emphasize a part of a beatmap.
A player can tell if a part of a beatmap has a kiai timing section by seeing added visual effects such as flashing beats, flying stars, and fountains.

Do note, abuse of kiai can be disorienting!
Thus mappers are advised to use it judiciously.

### Kudosu!

![](img/Kudosu-Durp.png "Kudosu! Durp")

![](img/Givekudosu.jpg "Button to give a Kudosu!")

Kudosu is a form of reward obtained from modding beatmaps.
The term "Kudosu" is named after a combination of the words "kudos" and "osu!".

A rating system that rewards users that mod regularly.
If you're a BN, or the creator of the map, you can award 1 or 2 kudosu to a user depending on the time since last post on the beatmap thread, making a constructive modding post.
Accumulated kudosu can be used to increase a beatmap's priority rating.
Any mapper or modder may spend 1 kudosu to give any map a star, which will help the map in the approval process by giving it more star priority.

Before awarding kudosu keep the following things in mind:

- Did the post help you in any way **to improve your map**?
- Did the modder post things **that AIMod cannot pick up**?
- Did the post show that the modder has **knowledge of modding**?
- Did the modder post things that generally **make sense to you and seem not too terribly picky?** If their post did seem picky, are you sure that the things pointed out **can improve your mapset anyways?**
- Even if you **don't** follow the modder's advice, did you not follow it because of **your personal choice only**, and not because **the modding seemed pointless to you?**
- Did you not already give the modder kudosu for a mod post on the same map **recently**, and if you did, has the map **vitally changed** between the two mod posts (adding a difficulty, remapping a difficulty)?
- Was this a **substantial mod post?** Did the mod post point out more than a couple of things to improve or fix your map?

If you can answer yes to all of these questions, **feel free to give the modder their well-earned kudosu!**

The creators of a beatmap can give a modder kudosu by simply going to the mod post and click the `Give Kudos` button that is located under the poster's information.
Please be aware that beatmap nominators may revoke your kudosu if they deem that your post should not have been awarded kudosu!

## L

### Lead-in

The lead-in time is a 3 second time period of silence that might automatically be inserted before the beginning of a beatmap.
This only happens if the beatmapper has placed objects right at or very close at the start of the song.

### Life bar

The life bar, also known as the health bar, HP bar, spirit bar, or ki bar, is a bar at the top left of the playing screen for osu!standard, osu!catch, and osu!taiko.
For osu!mania, the life bar is rotated 90 degrees counter-clock-wise and is placed next to the bottom-right of the stage.

In all modes, expect for osu!mania, there is a symbol moving along it indicating the player's life.
If the bar is completely empty, the player fails the current beatmap (assuming no special game modifiers are enabled).

The bar drains at a constant rate throughout the course of a beatmap, except during a break.
A sizeable part of the bar is also depleted in case of a miss.
The bar is replenished by the player tapping hit circles, following sliders and slider ticks, and spinning spinners.
The more accurate the tapping, the bigger the boost.
The player also receives larger boosts if he achieves a katu or an geki at the end of a combo.

### Local song offset

The local song offset is an offset set for individual beatmaps, not the entire beatmapset itself.
This is to offset the beatmap's offset alongside the global offset.

## M

### M4M

M4M, or Mod for Mod, is a term describing when a modder agrees to mod another modder's map in return for a mod on their own map.

### Marathon

A marathon is a type of beatmap that can only be approved.

Marathon beatmaps are considered to be at least 6 minutes long and can only have one mapped difficulty.
However, some marathon mapsets may contain a single osu!taiko variant as well.

Marathon beatmaps are often collaborative efforts, as mapping longer tracks is a draining endeavour when done solo.

Upon the creation of the marathon beatmap, one should name their beatmap version "Marathon" to bypass the BSS from preventing the pending status.

### MAT

**As of the April 23, 2013, all members of the MAT at that time were promoted as full members of the BAT, with the MAT team decommissioned.**

The MAT, meaning Modding Assistance Team, was a group of users experienced in modding.
MAT members can mark beatmap they approve of with a bubble, noting them as worthy of further consideration by the BAT.

### Modder

A modder is a term given to a user that gives comments or suggestions on another mapper's maps in the forums.

Activities are shown either at [Works In Progress/Help](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/10) (including the [Modding Queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/60)) and/or [Pending Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/6).

## N

### NC

NC has two meanings:

1. short for new combo, a modding term to suggest that a beat needs to be the start of a new combo
2. an abbreviation for the nightcore mod, a variant of the double time mod that increases the pitch of the music and adds a consistent bass drum beat to the music.

### Nuke

Any beatmap that is considered to be disregarding the rules (or the mapper disregarding the Code of Conduct) can be nuked.
Nuked beatmaps are considered "closed" until significant changes are made and the status is manually removed by a member of the team.

Examples include but are not limited to:

- not following the basics of the guidelines
  - containing really bad timing
  - has objects placed randomly on the grid and/or timeline but are also extremely challenging or unconventional beatmaps (e.g. consisting of a single spinner).

The warning icon that accompanies nuked beatmaps is the symbol for radioactive materials (![Radioactive.gif](/wiki/shared/Radioactive.gif)).

## O

### Offset

The offset is a period of time between the beginning of a beatmap’s song file and the instant the first beat of the rhythm is heard, from which the position of the first beat is calculated.
This is measured in milliseconds (ms).

The offset is the first half of beatmap timing, where the other half is the BPM.

### osu!

osu! has three meanings:

- the rhythm video game for the Microsoft Windows Operating Systems. Spelled with a lowercase "o" and an exclamation mark at the end.
- osu!standard, the game mode that osu! was originally based on.
- An informal greeting in the Japanese language, resulting from condensing the phrase "Ohayo gozaimasu!" (Good morning!) Pronounced with a silent u ("OSS"). Close English equivalents include "Yo!" or "Hey!". To read more about its meaning in Japanese language and culture, see [Does anyone here speak/learn Japanese?](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/p/2686).

### osu!academy

The osu!academy is a YouTube channel hosted by the osu!user, [ztrot](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6347).

The osu!academy aims to give a comprehensive look at all aspects of osu!, from playing to mapping and everything in-between.

For more information, see [osu!academy](/wiki/Announcements/osu!academy).

### osu!coin

- osu!academy introduces the osu!coins: [Introduction to osu!coins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BImc5McuK1o)
- peppy announces the osu!coins: [osu!coins!](https://osu.ppy.sh/news/115118189213)

The osu!coin was the ingame currency that was still "in development", as a 2015 April Fools joke.

After peppy realizes that the current rate of return wouldn't allow him to purchase a private jet within his lifetime, the osu!coin was introduced as the new ingame currency.
Every player will start off with 10 osu!coins and will be given 10 osu!coins per day.
Existing users will get an additional two osu!coins right off the bat.

One osu!coin will give the player one play, while retrying a beatmap will consume one osu!coin.
If the player obtains a combo that is a multiple of 100, they will obtain one osu!coin.
If the player runs out of osu!coins, they may purchase more—out of their own will—with these exchange rates:

- 1USD = 1 osu!coin
- 10USD = 10 osu!coins
- 999USD = 1000 osu!coins (0.001% savings!)
- first unborn child = infinite osu!coins (unborn child will work for osu!)

The following day, peppy rolled back the implementation of osu!coins due to popular demand, and ended with [this remark](https://disq.us/p/w2ydos).

### osupixel

An osupixel is the representation of one screen pixel when osu! is running in 640x480 resolution.
osupixels are one of the main coordinate systems used in osu!, and apply to hit circle placement and storyboard screen coordinates (these pixels are scaled over a 4:3 ratio to fit your screen).

In contrast, textures are scaled such that one texture pixel ([texel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texel_%28graphics%29)) corresponds to one screen pixel at 1024x768 resolution.

### Ouendan

Ouendan has three meanings:

- In Japanese culture, a cheer squad which, similar to western cheerleaders, rallies a sports team on using drums, horns, banners and yells of encouragement.
- The pair of Japanese DS games that osu! was based on. This term may sometimes be used to refer specifically to the first of these games.
- A collective term for the playable characters in the aforementioned games, i.e. "The Ouendan".

### Overmap

Overmapping is when the beats or placement of beats is placed in a way that makes the difficulty of the map contrast the actual song.
This can be done by adding unnecessary jumps, slider speed-ups, or by mapping to an unknown beat in the music consistently (ie. adding notes on blue ticks when the song is only using red ticks), in order to add difficulty.

There are two ways to avoid this:

1. Jumps, slider speed-ups, and other difficulty increasing techniques should only be used when they fit with the music.
   - If there is no sudden change that requires (or could greatly be supplemented with) then simply don't add them.
   - Insane beatmaps are not to show how hard you can make a beatmap, but rather how well you can make a map that is difficult but fun.
2. The map might not need an Insane difficulty.
   - If you feel that your map is too boring without adding a plethora of difficulty increasing techniques, then maybe your map does not need it.
   - Remember, mapsets do not require a Insane difficulty, so you'll be just fine without one.

This topic was discussed in an episode of osu!talk ([osu!talk special Over Mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RepSYE3hN3A)) that overmapping actually has a positive effect in osu!taiko maps because the drums plays an important role in a song.

## P

### Pass

Pass has three meanings:

- the completion of a beatmap with or without the use of mods
- the player having more than 50% health during a break; where an indicator will display if you passed the section

### peppy

peppy, written with a lowercase p, is the online alias of Dean Herbert.
He is the creator of the osu! project and its primary developer.

### Play time

Play time is the total duration of a beatmap.
This includes the lead-in time and the break time(s).

### puush

puush is a screen capturing and file uploading application developed by peppy.
puush is a successor of sorts to upppy which is commonly used to upload and share images in osu!.

For more information about puush, see [puush / home](https://puush.me/).

## Q

### QAT

QAT, meaning Quality Assurance Team, members are the ones responsible for ensuring that beatmaps will remain playable and enjoyable.

## R

### Rank

Rank has three meanings:

1. another word for a grade
2. a player’s standing in the online leaderboard (a.k.a. player ranking)
3. the verb "to rank", which is when someone second another moderator’s nomination and include a submitted beatmap to the ranked beatmap list, making scores achieved by anyone playing it count towards each player’s ranking. Getting their beatmaps ranked is a goal of every beatmapper.

### Ranking

Ranking&mdash;alternatively called "leaderboard"&mdash;is a list that sorts members of the osu!community according to certain criteria.
This can also refer to one's position in such a list.

osu! currently has three rankings:

- Player rankings: the ranking most commonly referred to, this list sorts players depending on their ranked score. Ranked score is the sum of the highest scores that a player has achieved in every ranked beatmap they had played. Scores achieved from ranked beatmaps are taken into account. Only one score from each beatmapset (the highest) is taken into account, regardless of how many difficulty versions it has.
- Beatmapper rankings: this list sorts everyone who has created at least one ranked beatmap, depending on the weighted average of all the ratings given to their beatmaps by other players, multiplied by a bonus modifier that increases the more ranked beatmaps they have.
- Moderator rankings: this list sorts moderators depending on how many posts they have made in the beatmap sub-forums, i.e. how much beatmap modding they are doing.

### Recalc

Recalc is short for "Recalculate slider lengths".
Recalc is a command under the `Timing` header of the editor screen.

Usage of this is suggested after a BPM change is made, if the beatmap already has sliders.
This command will automatically adjust the length of every slider in the beatmap to the new BPM.
If used, it is important, especially if a large change in BPM has been made, to check every slider and adjust its length manually, where necessary.

### Resnap

Resnap is a pair of commands under the `Timing` header of the editor screen.
One of which applies to the entire beatmap and the other to the current timing section (if the beatmap has only one timing section, both commands are the same).

Usage is suggested when there has been a change in offset and/or BPM, after objects have been placed.
This command will automatically reposition all objects on the timeline so that they fall on the closest beat division your snap divisor allows.
If used, it is important, especially if a large change in BPM and/or offset has been made, to check every object and adjust its position on the timeline manually, where necessary.

### RSI

RSI, meaning Repetitive Strain Injury, is a type of injury that affects the musculoskeletal and nervous system of the body.
It can be caused by repetitive tasks in awkward positions which may include playing osu! for an extended amount of time.

## S

### Sample set

A sample set is the collection of sound effects that are heard during gameplay.

These are categorized under three names:

- Normal
- Soft
- Drum

Inside each categories has these four hitsounds:

- _(normal)_ (the sound when none of the below is used)
- whistle
- clap
- final

However, there are other parts of a sample set that may include the slider tick sounds and the sound made when filling the spinner metre.

### Silence

A silence is an action taken against an osu!user who spams the osu!chat.
Silences will stack on top of each other, adding more time for each one.

Silences lasts for 4 weeks before being reset, along with the time that gets added.

### Skin

A skin is a set of graphics and custom sample sets that can be chosen to replace the default ones used by osu! in order to customise one's playing experience.
Most of what you see and hear in osu! can be skinned.

To see the dedicated sub-forum for skins, see [Skinning](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/15).

For a list of skinnable elements, see [Skinning](/wiki/Skinning/).

For a tutorial, see [Skinning Tutorial](/wiki/Skinning/Tutorial/).

### Skinner

A skinner refers to the osu!user who releases downloadable skins on the osu!forums. They may have had used an photo editing application such as GIMP or Photoshop.

### Sliderbreak

In osu!standard, a sliderbreak is when the player loses their combo by not holding a slider long enough.
This can occur by the player moving their cursor out of the slider circle or not hitting the beginning of the slider (but within the follow circle of the slider).
This will give a score of 100 or 50 for the slider, depending on how much slider ticks are missed.
Unlike missing, you can still achieve an "S" rank after sliderbreaking.

### Slider tick

The slider tick is a hitobject that gives out 10 points.
The amount of slider ticks used in a slider is dependent on the slider velocity, the BPM and the inherited timing.

### Spectate

Spectate, or spec, is when someone watches another player playing a beatmap in real time (with approx. 500ms delay).
To spectate, open the extended chat and click on a grey user panel.

For this to work, you'll need to have a copy of the exact same beatmap the player you wish to spectate is playing.
However, if you have an [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter/) tag, the beatmapset will be downloaded and loaded for you.

### Spectator aura

Spectator aura is a mysterious phenomenon that could cause players to choke their combo, or fail a beatmap from having a spectator(s) spectate their gameplay.

### Spinner spam

Spinner spam is a mapping technique that is heavily discouraged.

As the name sugguests, spinner spam occurs when a mapper spams many very short spinners (that last for ~2 sec or less) one after another.
On the other hand, there is the inverse of this, very long spinners that are placed right after another.

Before considering this mapping technique, it is very important to note:

- apinners can cause fatigue to the player, since it requires rapid, repetitive, and vigorous motion
- the circular motion of a spinner will cause the cursor to be placed in random locations after completion.
  - This will confuse the player when they are needed to click the next object(s).

### Stacked

Stacked objects are hitobjects that overlap each other in the playfield.
The most common object that is stacked are hitcircles.

Stacking hitcircles&mdash;while a clear violation of beat spacing&mdash;is, nevertheless, permitted if the hitcircles are very close to each other in the timeline (half a beat or usually even less).

### Star

Star has two meanings:

1. a stage in a beatmap’s modding process where a moderator judges a beatmap to be on the right track but needing some improvements before he approves of it with a bubble
   - examples include adjustments in timing, incorrect beat spacing in some areas, or creating additional difficulty versions
   - beatmaps receiving a star are denoted by a star graphic next to their thread’s title
   - a star may be removed by another mod if he judges the beatmap to need a rather larger amount of improvements than expected
2. another term for "difficulty stars"

### Star priority

Star priority has two meanings:

1. star priority is a method of helping Beatmap Nominators to find beatmaps worthy of bubbling and later ranking.
   - the star priority of a beatmap is determined by how many mod posts that have gained kudosu in the beatmap's thread, the sum of kudosu stars the map set has received
   - a kudosu star can be given by any user to any map, though shooting a kudosu star comes at the price of one kudosu
   - the conversion rate was formerly three kudosu for one kudosu star that increased the Star Priority by two
   - the higher the star priority, the higher the beatmap's thread appears in the Works in Progress or Pending subforum.
   - at least 12 star priority is needed for a map to be bubbled or ranked
2. a method in determining whether a Feature Request is wanted by the community
   - the higher the star priority, the faster it gets noticed
   - users that have supporter status active when voting will shoot a pink star (![Kudosu](/wiki/shared/Kudos.png)) that increases Star Priority by 2 each, whilst a user without supporter will shoot a blue star (![Star](/wiki/shared/Star.gif)) that is worth only 1 each. Users may be able to shoot multiple stars depending on how many votes they have left.

### Storyboard

A storyboard is a set of still and/or animated images and sound effects that tells a story during a beatmap’s course but especially before the beatmap’s beginning, during breaks and after the beatmap’s end.
In the DS games, storyboards concern one or more persons facing a difficult challenge or predicament which they then try to overcome whilst being cheered on by the player-controlled characters to the tune of a song.
Therefore, a storyboard can take various directions depending on the player’s performance.
osu!storyboarding is supported through the use of a scripting language or through the storyboard editor which can be accessed in editor mode under "Design".

There is a sub-forum dedicated to storyboards, see [Storyboarding](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/20).

### Storyboard editor

The storyboard editor can be found under `Design` in the editor in edit mode.
As the name implies, storyboards can be easily created and edited here.

### Storyboarder

A storyboarder refers to the osu!user who makes storyboards for their own or someone else's beatmap.
They may have used the editor's design section to storyboard, used a third party application, or have done Storyboard Scripting (or SBS).

### Stream

A stream is a mapping technique that requires the mapper to place a long series of hitobjects in short but rapid succession.
Steams does not require the hitobjects to be in the same comboset.

### SV

SV, meaning slider velocity, is the speed in which the slider moves at in relation to the BPM.
This term may sometimes be used during the modding process.

## T

### TAG

A TAG difficulty is a type of beatmap version that is designed for more than one person to play at the same time in multiplayer mode.

Each player is responsible for one comboset, where each hitobject in that comboset is mapped to be extremely farther apart, making it nearly impossible to play by a single player.
Therefore it becomes a challenge for elite players in terms of precision of jumping.

TAG difficulties are usually named TAG in a beatmap set.
TAG2 maps are meant for 2 players while TAG4 maps (the hardest) are meant for 4 players.

Note that tag difficulties are unrankable because they are far too hard to be ranked and are not designed for the single player. However, this hasn't stop pros from trying.

### Tablet

A graphics tablet is an alternative input medium to the computer mouse.

A tablet consists of a flat surface on which one can point and/or drag using an attached stylus, if one is included.
The image of the screen does not appear on the tablet, thus making it different in functionality from a touch screen.

### Tap

In osu!standard, tapping is a term that means "to press a button while the cursor is over a hitobject".
Tapping hitobjects at the right moment, as indicated by the beatmap’s music and the approach circle, is an essential part of osu! gameplay.
There are a few different buttons one can use to tap:

-     the left and right mouse buttons,
-     the `Z` and `X` keys on the keyboard,
-     using the buttons on the tablet/touchpad, or
-     directly on a touchscreen/tablet

### Test mode

Test mode is a feature of the beatmap editor.
This allows you to best your beatmap without having to submit anything.
However, you are required to overwrite and save the beatmap before continuing.
This creates issues if you need to rollback on your recent changes.

### Time signature

The time signature is a musical term that indicats how many beats are in each measure and what note value constitutes a single beat.
osu! offers two alternative time signatures, which can be selected from the Timing menu: 4/4, which is the one most commonly used, and 3/4, which is selected when the rhythm of the song is of, or similar to, a waltz.

### Timing

Good timing of a beatmap is big a requirement for a beatmap to get ranked.
Timing a beatmap consists of determining the offset and then the BPM of the song it uses.

When the tempo changes, you are required to add a new timing section to accompany the new tempo.

The timing process creates the timeline on which objects will be placed.

One of many reasons as to why your timing of a beatmap is important is because osu! takes the given BPM and offset to determine where the hitobjects should go.
If your timing is off, even by a little, then it is next to unrankable to map hitobjects on the editor.

### Timing section

A timing section is a part of a song which follows a different rhythm than the parts preceding and following it.
Many songs have a constant tempo and thus a single timing section.
However, there may be some that have more.
If this does happen, the beatmapper needs to identify any areas where the song BPM and/or time signature changes and find the timing for each one.

Timing sections can also be used even if the rhythm of the song remains constant throughout the beatmap, for example in order to allow the beatmapper to assign different sample sets to different parts of the song.
Those are called "inherited timing sections" and are identified by green lines.

### Touchscreen

A touchscreen is one of the input mediums used by the DS games that osu! is based on.
osu! supports touchscreen functionality, but the hardware required is generally expensive for the average player.
A computer whose entire screen functions as a touchscreen is called a Tablet PC.
This is different than a tablet because a touchscreen has some kind of display while tablets don't.

### Touchpad

A touchpad is a substitute for the computer mouse.
Touchpads are most commonly found on laptop computers.
The touchpad usually consists of a small rectangular area which one can drag one’s finger to move the mouse cursor.
Due to the way touchpads are designed, they do not work with a stylus or similar devices.

## U

### Universal offset

The universal offset is the time delay between:

- the object graphics and sample set sounds associated with them and
- the point of the song where they should be heard.

The universal offset applies to all songs used in osu! and its value differs according to each system's specifications.
After being determined, it doesn't need to be modified again.
An incorrectly universal offset will cause timing problems in every beatmap played or edited.
If everything sounds off to you while playing a few ranked beatmaps, try checking your universal offset.
The universal offset settings is located in the Options.

### upppy

upppy is a fast and easy-to-use uploading service coded by peppy.
If you want to share a file with the osu!community, forget about depositing it on Rapidshare, Megaupload, ImageShack and the like, just put it on upppy and everyone's happy! :)

For more information about upppy, see [upppy!](https://up.ppy.sh/) **(NSFW: there may be a few stray images that may contain R18 work)**.

## V

### Version

Version has two meanings:

- the specific beatmap of the beatmapset
  - this term can be used in place of beatmap to prevent disambiguation
  - they could be called "Easy", "Normal", "Hard", "Insane", and "Expert"
  - however, beatmappers are allowed to give custom names to the difficulty versions of their beatmaps
- the version of a skin
  - see [Skinning](/wiki/Skinning/)

## W

### WIP

WIP is an acronym for work in progress.

There are various reasons to mark a beatmap as WIP:

- deemed incomplete by its creator
  - incomplete difficulty versions,
  - only one difficulty versions or not enough difficulty versions,
  - pending correction,
  - suggestions on the timing,
  - needs feedback

WIPs can be submitted through the BSS to the Beatmap Help forum to get comments, feedback and help from mods and other users.

## Z

### z/x

z/x are the default keys on the keyboard to tap in osu!.
A very popular alternative to the left and right mouse buttons.

During gameplay, while `Z` is pressed, the left mouse button will not work and vice versa.
The same applies to the `X` key and the right mouse button and vice versa.

The keyboard tapping keys can be changed in the options menu.
