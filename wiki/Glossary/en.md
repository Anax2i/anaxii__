Throughout the years, the [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community has adopted its own set of slang that may be confusing for newcomers. This page is a compilation of such terms for reference. Additions and edits are always welcome.

Links with a prefixed "\#" symbol are also terms of this glossary, while blue links link to other articles.

### Abandoned Wasteland

**Abandoned wasteland** is a hidden sub-forum. If the name isn't obvious enough, the instructions to the moderators concerning it will: "Put stuff we don't really need in here." When a thread is "wastelanded", it is moved there.

### AFK

**AFK** is an internet acronym which means "**A**way **F**rom **K**eyboard". This is when the player walks off from their keyboard to do something else while they're still logged on. If the user is inactive for sometime, they'll be marked **AFK** automatically.

### Approach Circle

The **approach circle** is the outermost circle that will enclose the [\#Hitcircle](#Hitcircle "wikilink"), the start of a [Slider](Slider "wikilink"), or the center of the [\#Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink"). When the **approach circle** touches the outer border of the [\#Hitcircle](#Hitcircle "wikilink") or [Slider](Slider "wikilink") you should click. For the [\#Spinners](#Spinner "wikilink"), the **approach circle** will indicate the duration of the [\#Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink").

### Approach Rate (AR)

  
*Main Article: [Song Setup\#Approach Rate](Song_Setup#Approach_Rate "wikilink")*

The **approach rate**, or AR for short, is a number (from 0 to 10) that indicates how fast the [\#Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink") will enclose the [hitobject](hitobject "wikilink") and how long that [hitobject](hitobject "wikilink") will stay on the screen. This affects from the moment they appear until the time to click on them. Higher **approach rates** mean that the [hitobject](hitobject "wikilink") will be shown for a shorter period of time, giving you less reaction time to plan ahead when to click on them. Inversely, lower **approach rates** mean that the [hitobject](hitobject "wikilink") will be shown on the screen for a longer time, giving you more time to react to each circle. Do note that if the **approach rate** is too low, this can result in excessive amount number of circles on the screen, a similar flaw of [\#Easy](#Easy "wikilink").

### Authentic

**Authentic** is a word that denotes a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") that emulates in every aspect of a specific stage from the [\#DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") (song, settings, [object](object "wikilink") placement, etc.).

### Ban

**Ban** is an action taken to a player if caught [cheating](cheating "wikilink"). For [chat](IRC "wikilink") abuse, multiple warnings, or [\#Silences](#Silence "wikilink"), would usually be issued before a **ban** is given. To avoid getting **banned**, please read the [rules](rules "wikilink")! Don't have time? Do not worry, read the [short rules](short_rules "wikilink") instead (but you should still read the [rules](rules "wikilink") some other time)!

### Banana

Banana.png|Default skin for the bananas during gameplay

**Bananas** is a [skinning element](Skinning_Catch_the_Beat "wikilink") for [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink") and is the [\#Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink") equivalent. When you see **Bananas** falling from you should try to catch as many as you can. **Bananas** is not counted towards your [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink"), but can give the player an additional bonus depending on how much the player catches.

### Bancho

**Bancho** is the easily expandable server coded by [\#peppy](#peppy "wikilink"), which replaces third-party [IRC](IRC "wikilink") servers in the management of all online content in [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink"). Players automatically connect to **Bancho** when they start [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink"), that is, if the player is connected to the internet.

### BAT

  
*This term is to help preserve the history of the **BAT**s*

The **BAT** team—which is short for the **B**eatmap **A**ppreciation **T**eam—was a group of users that would rank beatmaps<sup>\[Citation\\ Needed\]</sup>. This team was eventually renamed to the "[Beatmap Nominator](Beatmap_Nominator "wikilink")".

### Beat

**Beat** is a term that applies to the timeline in [Editor](Editor "wikilink") mode. The **beat** is a period of time that songs can be divided into based off of their [\#BPM](#BPM "wikilink"). Correctly [timed](Timing "wikilink") [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") will have each beat correspond to the song's rhythm. A whole beat should fall between two white lines on the timeline. Depending on the position of your [Snap Divisor](Beat_Snap_Divisor "wikilink"), other lines dividing a beat may be visible: Red lines for half beats, blue lines for quarter beats, yellow lines for eighth beats and purple lines for third and sixth beats.

### Beatmap Pack

<div id="Song Pack">
</div>
**Beatmap packs**, if the name isn't clear, are packaged beatmaps. **Beatmap packs** are collections [ranked beatmaps](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") that can be downloaded by file sharing services. Most **beatmap packs** are sets of beatmaps that were ranked during the same time period, but in other packs contain songs of a similar style or theme.

This is the recommended way of downloading [\#Beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") because these **beatmap packs** are usually themed to go together and this method of downloading beatmaps would save [\#peppy](#peppy "wikilink") bandwidth (since these packs are hosted on third party servers, usually by other osu!users). You can view the **beatmap packs** \[//osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist here\].

### Beat Spacing

**Beat Spacing** is a principle which states that [\#Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") and [Sliders](Sliders "wikilink") that correspond to parts of the song close to each other on the timeline should be close together on the play field, and vice versa. Simply put, "close in time = close in space." Consistent **Beat Spacing** is generally a requirement to [rank](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") a beatmap because it provides the player with a more intuitive experience, as he will learn to move their cursor along the screen at a constant speed. Placing objects closer than Beat Spacing would indicate tricks the player into clicking on them too soon, while placing them too far forces the player to race their cursor across the screen to click on them in time. A common exception to **Beat Spacing** is [Stacked](Stacked "wikilink") [\#Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"). To ensure consistent Beat Spacing, turn the [Distance Snap](Distance_Snap "wikilink") button on the right-hand side of the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") screen on. Then, choose a Beat Spacing value by holding Alt and sliding the selector at the top right until you reach the desired value. The higher the value, the more difficult the [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") is.

### Beatmap

<div id="Map">
</div>
<div id="Level">
</div>
A **beatmap**, sometimes called "Level" or "Map" for short, is a game level in [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink"), like each stage in the [\#DS games](#DS_games "wikilink"). At their most basic form, beatmaps have a song and [\#Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), [Sliders](Slider "wikilink"), and/or [\#Spinners](#Spinner "wikilink") placed according to the rhythm of the music, but they can also have a background image or video, or even a [storyboard](storyboard "wikilink"). Creators of beatmaps are called beatmappers or mappers for short. Beatmaps are uploaded for everyone to see and play with using the [\#BSS](#BSS "wikilink"), and are then [modded](Modding "wikilink"). If/Once a beatmap is deemed good enough, it is [ranked](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") or, in rare cases, [approved](Approved_beatmap "wikilink").

### Beatmapper

<div id="Mapper">
</div>
<div id="Mappers">
</div>
**Beatmapper**, or "Mapper" for short, refers to the osu!user who uses the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") to create a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), which will have to go through a process to get [\#Ranked](#Ranked "wikilink") (or [\#Approved](#Approved "wikilink")).

### Beatmapset

<div id="Mapset">
</div>
A **beatmapset**, or "mapset" for short, is the collection of [\#Beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") that are packaged as an `*.osz` file, under the same [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink"). **Beatmapsets** have [\#Beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") that plays the same music and, if any, video or [storyboard](storyboard "wikilink").

### Beta

**Beta** is a [\#Build](#Build "wikilink") type that contains daily-to-weekly osu!client updates that were added in from the [\#Cutting Edge (Experimental)](#Cutting_Edge_(Experimental) "wikilink") [\#Builds](#Build "wikilink"). **Beta** is experimental-like (but stabler than) [\#Cutting Edge (Experimental)](#Cutting_Edge_(Experimental) "wikilink") because [\#Cutting Edge (Experimental)](#Cutting_Edge_(Experimental) "wikilink") users can test these features first a few days/weeks before **Beta** users get those features.

### BG

**BG** is short for "**B**ack**G**round" which refers to the background image and/or video of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). Inside a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") folder, **BG** is usually the name for the background image.

### BPM

  
*Main Article: [Timing](Timing "wikilink")*

**BPM** (short for **B**eats **P**er **M**inute) represents the number of whole beats in a minute.

### Break

**Break** is a section of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") where no [objects](objects "wikilink") appear and [\#Drain](#Drain "wikilink") in the [Life Bar](Life_Bar "wikilink") is temporarily halted. **Breaks** allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their input device. A **break** is also accompanied by a graphic illustrating whether the player is doing well (the Life Bar is over a certain point) or poorly (the Life Bar is under it), if there is enough time within that **break**. In the [\#DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") as well as beatmaps with [Storyboards](Storyboards "wikilink"), this graphic is accompanied by a fitting plot development. Roughly speaking, breaks should be placed, if possible, between every 40 seconds-1 minute and 20 seconds of playtime and last about 5-15 seconds, but will depend per song because **breaks** have to make sense in a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), affecting **break** placement.

### BSS

  
*Main Article: [Submission](Submission "wikilink")*<img src="BSS_Base.jpg" title="fig:BSS window in the Editor" alt="BSS window in the Editor" width="250" />

Short for "[\#**B**eatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") **S**ubmission **S**ystem". An automated process by which one submits their [\#Beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") to the Beatmap Help or Completed Beatmaps forums for people to see, comment on, [mod](Modding "wikilink") and [rank](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink"). **BSS** allows the [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") to do either action: [\#Standard Submission](#Standard_Submission "wikilink") and [\#Full Submission](#Full_Submission "wikilink").

### Bubble

A stage in a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink")'s [modding](modding "wikilink") process where a [BN](BN "wikilink") and a [GMT](GMT "wikilink") is satisfied with every aspect of the beatmap and nominates it for [ranking](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink"). Denoted by a thought bubble graphic (this one ![](Thinking.gif "fig:Thinking.gif")) by the beatmap's thread title. The beatmap is then ranked if a [BN](BN "wikilink")/[GMT](GMT "wikilink") seconds that nomination. A bubble might be downgraded to a [\#Star](#Star "wikilink") (![](star.gif "fig:star.gif")) under certain circumstances, but never removed altogether.

### Build

A version of the [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") application. Each build includes improvements, additions and fixes of problems the previous one had. There are four kinds of Builds: the [\#Stable (Latest)](#Stable_(Latest) "wikilink"), [\#Stable (Fallback)](#Stable_(Fallback) "wikilink"), [\#Beta](#Beta "wikilink"), and the [\#Cutting Edge (Experimental)](#Cutting_Edge_(Experimental) "wikilink"). One can download the most current Build by selecting the stream (build type) in the [Options](Options "wikilink").

C

### Changelog

The **changelog** is a forum thread where [\#peppy](#peppy "wikilink") and the dev team details the day-by-day improvements, additions and bug fixes made in everything concerning [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") You can view it \[//osu.ppy.sh/p/changelog here\]. Everyday changes are added to the [\#Cutting Edge (Experimental)](#Cutting_Edge_(Experimental) "wikilink") and are eventually added to the [\#Beta](#Beta "wikilink"), [\#Stable (Latest)](#Stable_(Latest) "wikilink"), and/or [\#Stable (Fallback)](#Stable_(Fallback) "wikilink") [\#Builds](#Build "wikilink").

### Choke

<div id="Reverse Choke">
</div>
A **choke** occurs when the player almosts obtains a [\#Full Combo](#Full_Combo "wikilink") for [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") but loses it near the end. On the other hand, a **reverse choke** occurs when the player loses their [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") at the beginning but obtains a [\#Full Combo](#Full_Combo "wikilink") for the rest of the [\#Map](#Map "wikilink").

### Circle Size (CS)

<div id="Circle Size">
</div>
<div id="CS">
</div>
  
''Main Article: [Song Setup\#Circle Size](Song_Setup#Circle_Size_.28osu.21.2C_Catch_the_Beat.2C_Taiko_only.29 "wikilink")

<img src="Circle sizes.png" title="fig:Comparison of the Circle Sizes" alt="Comparison of the Circle Sizes" width="300" />**Circle Size**, "CS" for short, is a number from 2 to 7. This value will determine how big or small the [hit objects](hit_objects "wikilink")/[\#Fruit](#Fruit "wikilink") will be. [Mania](Mania "wikilink") follows a uses a different scale which are called "[\#Keys](#Key "wikilink")."

### Clap

**Clap** is a sound effect, part of a [sample set](Sample_Set "wikilink"), usually reserved for emphasizing and punctuating points in a song more in a different way than the [\#Whistle](#Whistle "wikilink") and [\#Finish](#Finish "wikilink"). Its default form and icon in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") is that of two hands clapping.

### Collab

<div id="Collaboration">
</div>
  
*Similar to: [\#GD](#GD "wikilink") (**G**uest **D**ifficulty)*

**Collab**, short for "collaboration", has two meanings:

-   the work of multiple [\#Mappers](#Mapper "wikilink") [\#Mapping](#Mapping "wikilink") a single [\#Map](#Map "wikilink"); usually a [\#Marathon](#Marathon "wikilink") [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink").
    -   When collaborating on a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), the creator must [\#Map](#Map "wikilink") a majority (at least half) of the [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), this is to ensure that the creator has done enough to upload the map under their username.
-   the [\#Mapset](#Mapset "wikilink") containing [\#Guest Difficulties](#Guest_Difficulties "wikilink")

The term "**Collab**" may sometimes be seen in [\#Difficulty](#Difficulty "wikilink") names.

### Combo

<div id="Combos">
</div>
**Combo** has two meanings:

-   A set of [\#Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") and [Sliders](Slider "wikilink") that come one after another, have the same colour and correspond to a specific part of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink")'s song. The last object in each **combo**, if hit, provides the player with a boost to their [\#Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") if he also achieves a [\#Katu](#Katu "wikilink") (or [\#Beat!](#Beat! "wikilink")) or an [\#Geki](#Geki "wikilink") (or [\#Elite Beat!](#Elite_Beat! "wikilink")). Every [\#Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink") is a **combo** by itself (except for [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink")). **Combos** should be kept under approximately 20 [objects](objects "wikilink"), and even lower than that the lower the difficulty is supposed to be.
-   The number of [objects](objects "wikilink") a player has hit consecutively without [\#Missing](#Miss "wikilink") or [\#Sliderbreaking](#Sliderbreak "wikilink") once. The number is displayed at the bottom left of the playing field. Each [\#Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), beginning and end of a [Slider](Slider "wikilink"), [\#Slider Tick](#Slider_Tick "wikilink") and [\#Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink") that the player hits without [\#Missing](#Missing "wikilink") in between causes the **combo** to increase by one. When the **combo** passes certain numbers, [\#Combobursts](#Comboburst "wikilink") appear and stars flash across the screen. A single miss causes the Combo to reset and Combo Fire to vanish. Combo provides a bonus multiplier to the score of everything the player hits except Slider Ticks, which are always worth 10 points each, and every level filled in the [Spinner Metre](Spinner_Metre "wikilink") or Spinner bonus points, which is always worth 100 points and 1000 points each. Managing to finish a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") without missing once is called a [\#Full Combo](#Full_Combo "wikilink"). This is sometimes denoted by the phrase "Perfect!" on the results screen and will give an S [\#Grade](#Grade "wikilink") or higher (unless the accuracy is lower).

### Comboburst

<div id="Combo burst">
</div>
<div id="Combo bursts">
</div>
<div id="Combobursts">
</div>
<File:Comboburst.png%7CDefault> skin for *comboburst.png* <File:Comboburst-fruits.png%7CDefault> skin for *comboburst-fruits.png* <File:Comboburst-mania.png%7CDefault> skin for *comboburst-mania.png*

**Comboburst** is a collection of [skin](Skinning "wikilink") elements/images that will "burst" out from the left or right (or center, in [Mania](Mania "wikilink")) of the screen after obtaining a [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") of 30, 60, 100, (multiples of 50, after 100).
Referring to the default skin,

-   in [Standard](Standard "wikilink"), [Pippi](Mascots#Pippi "wikilink") is the only **comboburst** that will cheer you on.
-   in [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink"), [Yuzu](Mascots#Yuzu "wikilink") is the only **comboburst** that will cheer you on.
-   in [Mania](Mania "wikilink"), [Maria](Mascots#Maria "wikilink") is the only **comboburst** that will cheer you on.

### Combo Colour

<img src="ComboColourDiffer.png" title="fig:Left side: the highlighted hitcircles&#39; color are both blue. Right side: the highlighted hitcircles&#39; colors are blue then red (at start of new combo)." alt="Left side: the highlighted hitcircles&#39; color are both blue. Right side: the highlighted hitcircles&#39; colors are blue then red (at start of new combo)." width="300" /> To separate one [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") from another, each [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") has a colour, called **Combo Colour** (see image). When the colour of the [hitobject](hitobject "wikilink") changes, you know you have changed combos. The colours will keep repeating themselves depending on how many the [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") defined (or how many your skin's [Skin.ini](Skin.ini "wikilink") file defines). There is a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 **combo colours**.

One can change those colours and/or their order on the [Beatmap Editor](Beatmap_Editor "wikilink")'s Song Setup section (see [Beatmapping](Beatmapping "wikilink")), or in the skin being used, on the skin properties located on [Skin.ini](Skin.ini#.5BColours.5D "wikilink") (refer to section \[Colours\]).

The **combo colours** will only be seen in the [Standard](Standard "wikilink") and [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink") game modes.

### Combo Fire

<img src="CF_DEAD.jpg" title="fig:R.I.P. Combo Fire, you may be missed" alt="R.I.P. Combo Fire, you may be missed" width="200" /> The **combo fire** is an old and removed feature in [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") that used to display a burning yellow flame after obtaining a [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") of 30. If the player obtains a [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") of 500, the combo fire colour will change from yellow to blue. The **combo fire** will extinguish itself if the [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") was broken (but is reobtainable). This feature was deprecated (due to it possibly giving off lag spikes and having a bad appearance) then was removed.

### Cutting Edge (Experimental)

<div id="Cutting Edge">
</div>
<div id="osu!test">
</div>
**Cutting Edge (Experimental)** (previously known as "osu!test") is a [\#Build](#Build "wikilink") type that contains daily osu!client updates. After an update is written, they will be appended to the osu!clients that are running the **Cutting Edge (Experimental)** [\#Build](#Build "wikilink").

D

### Deathstreams

<div id="Deathstream">
</div>
  
*Main Article: [Deathstreams](Rhythm_Techniques#Deathstreams "wikilink")*

**Deathstreams** are particularly challenging and often extra long [Stream](Stream "wikilink") whose [objects](objects "wikilink") follow each other in very rapid succession and/or in confusing patterns. These usually causes the player to lose their stamina very quickly. **Deathstreams** are to only be used in a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") that hints it and/or has a high BPM only, but should NOT be used to [\#Overmap](#Overmap "wikilink")!

### Difficulty stars

**Difficulty stars** is the visual representation of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink")'s difficulty level. This rating is between (theoretically) 0 and 10 stars according to an algorithm. [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") currently uses two different algorithms to calculate difficulty stars: [\#peppy](#peppy "wikilink")'s which determines the bonus difficulty score multiplier, and 's, according to which the difficulty tags are assigned. There is also Echo's algorithm which is not currently implemented. You can see a beatmap's difficulty stars when testing it in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink"), on the song selection screen, or at its listing in the [site](Website "wikilink").

### Difficulties

<div id="Diff">
</div>
<div id="Difficulty">
</div>
[\#Beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") can have multiple **difficulties**, or "diff" for short, varying from [Easy](Easy_(Difficulty) "wikilink") to [Expert](Expert "wikilink"). A [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") should generally have two to five versions of varying difficulty, so that both novice and experienced players can enjoy playing it. Some factors that affect a version's difficulty are the number of [object](object "wikilink") in the beatmap, whether a main or background (harder to hear) rhythm is followed for object placement, the length of [\#Combos](#Combos "wikilink"), the [\#Beat Spacing](#Beat_Spacing "wikilink") value, the [\#Drain](#Drain "wikilink") rate, the accuracy limit the game requires to register a hit, the size of [\#Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), etc. [Difficulty](Difficulty "wikilink") stars are one way to gauge a version's difficulty level. The [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") website sorts difficulty versions into the [Easy](Easy_(Difficulty) "wikilink"), [Normal](Normal "wikilink"), [Hard](Hard "wikilink"), [Insane](Insane "wikilink"), and [Expert](Expert "wikilink") categories, but [\#Beatmappers](#Beatmapper "wikilink") are allowed to give custom names to the difficulty versions of their beatmaps.

### Drain Time

<div id="Drain">
</div>
  
*Not to be confused with: [\#HP Drain Rate](#HP_Drain_Rate "wikilink") or [\#Play Time](#Play_Time "wikilink")*

**Drain time**, or "Drain" for short, refers to the total duration of the [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") that requires the player to be active. **Drain time** does not consider the [\#Breaks](#Break "wikilink") and unmapped parts throughout the [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink").

### Drop

  
*Not to be confused with: [\#Droplets](#Droplet "wikilink")*

Fruit-drop.png|Default skin for *fruit-drop.png*

A **drop** is a [\#Slider Tick](#Slider_Tick "wikilink") for [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink"). Catching it will give you [\#100](#100 "wikilink") points. [\#Droplets](#Droplet "wikilink") uses the same skin element but are about 0.5x smaller.

### Droplet

  
*Not to be confused with: [\#Drop](#Drop "wikilink")*

Fruit-drop.png|Default skin for *fruit-drop.png*

A **droplet** is the slider trail (or path) for [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink"). Catching it will give you [\#10](#10 "wikilink") points. [\#Drops](#Drop "wikilink") uses the same skin element but are about twice as big.

### DS

**DS** is an abbreviation meaning **D**istance **S**napping. The term is usually seen during the [Modding](Modding "wikilink") process.

### DS games

Collective term for [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!](wikipedia:Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan! "wikilink") (also called Ouendan or Ouendan 1), [Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! 2](wikipedia:Moero!_Nekketsu_Rhythm_Damashii_Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan!_2 "wikilink") (almost always called "Ouendan 2 instead") and [Elite Beat Agents](wikipedia:Elite_Beat_Agents "wikilink") (also called [\#EBA](#EBA "wikilink")). A set of rhythm games, developed by [\#iNiS](#iNiS "wikilink") for the Nintendo DS handheld video game system, which share a lot of gameplay and presentation elements. [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") is mostly based on these games.

E

### EBA

**EBA** has two meanings:

1.  **E**lite **B**eat **A**gents, one of the [\#DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") which [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") is based on.
2.  A collective term for the playable characters in that game (referring to \#1), i.e. "The EBA" or "The Agents".

### Extended Chat

  
*Colour codes are explained at [Chat Console](Chat_Console#panels "wikilink")*

The **Extended Chat** can be activated by pressing \[F9\] in [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") where the Chat window is expanded with a list of user panels. These panels are sortable by various attributes. Users that are using the osu!client are displayed, not ones that are participating in chat from using a [IRC](IRC "wikilink") client. The user panels supply lots of information on each user. If the mouse cursor is placed on them. The colour of the user panels indicates the user's current activity.

F

### Fail

<div id="Failed">
</div>
<div id="Failing">
</div>
**Fail** refers to one of these three things:

-   the incompletion of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") due to low health.
-   in [Multiplayer](Multiplayer "wikilink"), an indicator underneath the player's name to show they have **failed** the [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink")
-   have less than 50% health during a break which an indicator will display if you [\#Passed](#Passed "wikilink") or **Failed**

### Finish

**Finish** is a sound effect, part of a [\#Sample Set](#Sample_Set "wikilink"). **Finish** is usually reserved for emphasizing and punctuating points in a song more emphatically than the [\#Whistle](#Whistle "wikilink"). Its default form and icon in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") is a cymbal clash.

### Full Combo

<div id="FC">
</div>
\[\[<File:CombosCanHurt.png%7C300px%7Cthumb%7Cright%7CTop>: score with a <b>Full Combo</b>
Bottom: score with a <b>Broken Combo</b>

<hr/>
By losing your combo halfway through the game, you could easily lose half as many points!\]\] A **full combo**, or "FC" for short, is when a player completes a [Beatmap](Beatmap "wikilink") while obtaining the maximum [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") possible. This does not account accuracy as it is often used to mean clearing a [Beatmap](Beatmap "wikilink") without having any [\#Misses](#Misses "wikilink") or [\#Sliderbreaks](#Sliderbreaks "wikilink"). **Full combos** usually give the most [Score](Score "wikilink") in the [Standard](Standard "wikilink") and [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink") modes.

### Full Submission

A **Full Submission** is a way to submit a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") through the [\#BSS](#BSS "wikilink"), making it available to the [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community. A **Full Submission** should be used when the [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") has added or removed images, background video, or [\#Sample Sets](#Sample_Sets "wikilink"). In all other cases, [\#Standard Submission](#Standard_Submission "wikilink") is preferable.

### Fruit

<File:Apple.png%7CDefault> look for the apple <File:Banana.png%7CDefault> look for the banana <File:Grapes.png%7CDefault> look for the grapes <File:Orange.png%7CDefault> look for the orange <File:Pear.png%7CDefault> look for the pear

**Fruits** are catchable [Objects](Objects "wikilink") for [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink"). Catching one of these will give you [\#300](#300 "wikilink") points.

G

### Geki

<div id="Elite Beat!">
</div>
Hit300g.png|Default skin for Geki (hit300g.png)

**Geki**, or "Elite Beat!", is a scoring term which is when you complete the [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") with only [\#300s](#300 "wikilink").

### GD

<div id="Guest Difficulty">
</div>
<div id="Guest Difficulties">
</div>
  
*Similar to: [\#Collab](#Collab "wikilink")*

**GD**, short for "**G**uest **D**ifficulty", is a [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") [\#Mapping](#Mapping "wikilink") another [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink")'s [\#Mapset](#Mapset "wikilink") (or a [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink"), other than its creator, [\#Mapping](#Mapping "wikilink") a [\#Difficulty](#Difficulty "wikilink")). **Guest Difficulties** usually have the [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink")'s username in the [\#Difficulty](#Difficulty "wikilink")'s name.

There are many reasons for **Guest Difficulties** to exist:

-   Etiquette in the community can make it difficult for multiple [\#Mappers](#Mappers "wikilink") to upload [\#Beatmaps](#Beatmaps "wikilink") of the same song around the same time. A different [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink"), interested in [\#Mapping](#Mapping "wikilink") that song, may choose to contribute a [\#Difficulty](#Difficulty "wikilink") to the other [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink")'s set instead.
-   They may also decide after-the-fact upon playing the other map that they like the music and want to create a difficulty for it.
-   or the [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") doesn't want to put in the effort in creating the [\#Difficulties](#Difficulties "wikilink") on their own, but rather would want to just create one and give it to another [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink").

On the other hand, it may be the creator who wants **Guest Difficulties**:

-   this—usually—is to give the [\#Mapset](#Mapset "wikilink") a "community effort" feel
-   or simply, they don't want to create such [\#Difficulties](#Difficulties "wikilink") by themselves.

**Guest Difficulties** are often requested by private messages in-game or via forum private messages. **Guest Difficulties** can also be requested in the [\#Modding Queues](#Modding_Queues "wikilink"), specifically queues that are offering to do them.

More than one guest [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") is allowed to contribute to a [\#Mapset](#Mapset "wikilink"), including [\#Mappers](#Mappers "wikilink") from any one of the four gamemodes. If an additional gamemode is to be featured in a [\#Mapset](#Mapset "wikilink"), that gamemode must have at least two [\#Difficulties](#Difficulties "wikilink") that follows the [Ranking Criteria](Ranking_Criteria "wikilink"). Each guest [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") is also allowed to create more than one [\#Difficulty](#Difficulty "wikilink") to contribute to the [\#Mapset](#Mapset "wikilink"), as long as the number of [\#Difficulties](#Difficulties "wikilink") created by the guest mapper does not exceed the number of [\#Difficulties](#Difficulties "wikilink") of the creator/uploader (this is to determine who should upload the [\#Mapset](#Mapset "wikilink")).

### Good

  
*Main Article: [Score\#Taiko Scoring Values](Score#Taiko_Scoring_Values "wikilink")*

Taiko-hit100.png|Default skin for *taiko-hit100.png* Taiko-hit100k.png|Default skin for *taiko-hit100k.png*

**Good** is a possible score for [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink") which is worth [\#100](#100 "wikilink") points.

### Grade

  
*Not to be confused with: [\#Rank](#Rank "wikilink")*

**Grade**, sometimes referred to as [\#Rank](#Rank "wikilink")—this term was renamed to prevent confusion with other terms sharing that name—is a letter **grade** that evaluates a player's performance when playing a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). It accompanies the total score at the [Result Screen](Result_Screen "wikilink") and appears in all lists where scores appear. From lowest to highest, the possible **grades** are D, C, B, A, S, Silver S, SS, and Silver S.

In order to achieve an S, one should not [\#Miss](#Miss "wikilink") when playing the beatmap and have at most a ratio of 1:10 of [\#100](#100 "wikilink") to [\#300s](#300 "wikilink"). In order to achieve an SS, one must only score [\#300s](#300 "wikilink"). There are also the Silver S and Silver SS grades, which are, respectively, an S and SS grade achieved when playing with the [\#Hidden](#Hidden "wikilink") [mod](Game_Modifiers "wikilink") enabled.

### Great

  
*Main Article: [Score\#Taiko Scoring Values](Score#Taiko_Scoring_Values "wikilink")*

Taiko-hit300.png|Default skin for *taiko-hit300.png* Taiko-hit300k.png|Default skin for *taiko-hit300k.png* Taiko-hit300g.png|Default skin for *taiko-hit300g.png*

**Great** is a possible score for [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink") which is worth [\#300](#300 "wikilink") points.

### Grid Snapping

**Grid snapping** is a button on the right side of the [editor](editor "wikilink") screen. Enabling it will force every newly placed (or existing, but moved) [object](object "wikilink") to snap along the intersections of the grid. The level of sparseness can be adjusted by pressing \[G\] or by going to *View* » *Grid Level*. **Grid snapping** can help with aligning objects to each other and arranging them in patterns.

### Graveyard

The [beatmap **graveyard**](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=19) is a collection of [\#Beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") that haven't had any activity for one month (4 weeks or so). They are moved to this sub-forum to keep the active beatmaps' sub-forum from being cluttered.

One can "resurrect" their beatmap from the **graveyard** by:

1.  going to your profile,
2.  click the "Beatmaps" tab,
3.  click "Graveyarded Beatmaps" tab,
4.  click "Resurrect" link

This will allow you to update the beatmap and work on it.

H

### Hitsounds

**Hitsounds** are the sounds that the game plays in response to user input when completing one of the [hit objects](hit_objects "wikilink") in the game. This is in contrast to the underlying music and sounds created by the user interface.

**Hitsounds** are used to provide an auditory feedback mechanism to the player to help them judge their timing. This is complementary to [approach circles](approach_circle "wikilink") and [spacing](spacing "wikilink"), the visual mechanisms used to communicate timing information.

Instead of a single **hitsound**, there are many others such as the [\#Whistle](#Whistle "wikilink"), [\#Clap](#Clap "wikilink"), and [\#Finish](#Finish "wikilink"). These are added to make the **hitsounds** sound more expressive and let the player feel more like they are part of the music. [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") provides a wide array of **hitsounds** (eight in the stable release, since upgraded to twelve). Though, [\#Mappers](#Mapper "wikilink") can go further add sixteen more (24 in the test build). Sliders also have ambient sound effects when they are being performed successfully, including a recurrent ticking sound which matches the beat.

The default hitsounds can be found here: [Skinning Tutorial](Skinning_Tutorial "wikilink")

### HP Drain Rate

<div id="Drain Rate">
</div>
  
*Not to be confused with: [\#Drain Time](#Drain_Time "wikilink")*

**HP Drain Rate**, or "Drain Rate" for short, is a number (from 0 to 10) that determines the constant decrease in the [\#Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") throughout playing a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), except during [\#Breaks](#Break "wikilink"). [\#Beatmappers](#Beatmapper "wikilink") can adjust the drain rate of their beatmaps in the difficulty tab of the [Song Setup](Song_Setup "wikilink") dialog box in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink"). The higher the drain, the more difficult the beatmap is to [\#Pass](#Pass "wikilink"). Drain is the main reason that [\#Combos](#Combo "wikilink") must not be designed too long, in order to provide a good player with [\#Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") boosts frequently enough to counteract it.

### Ignore List

The **ignore list** is a blacklist of words or users that the user does not want to be displayed in the [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") chat.

### IRC

**IRC** is an abbreviation for "**I**nternet **R**elay **C**hat". This is the protocol that [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") uses for its ingame chat. Because of this, you can use your favorite **IRC** client to connect to the ingame chat without needing to open the osu!client. Connect to `irc.ppy.sh` and you will auto-join the \#osu channel.

### iNiS

  
*[Wikipedia description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INiS)*

**iNiS** is a Japanese video game developer that specializes in rhythm games. It is the creator of the three "[\#DS games](#DS_games "wikilink")" on which [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") is based on.

J
-

### Jump

  
*For techniques, see [Jumping Techniques](Jumping_Techniques "wikilink")*

A **jump** is when a [hit circle](hit_circle "wikilink") or [slider](slider "wikilink") that is close to another one of the timeline noticeably farther than [\#Beat spacing](#Beat_spacing "wikilink") would suggest, forcing the player to "jump" from one point of the screen to another to [\#Tap](#Tap "wikilink") it on time. More apparent, in early [\#Beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink") and even the first [\#Ouendan](#Ouendan "wikilink") game, **jumps** can make a beatmap more fun and thrilling... though they should be used very rarely and only on harder [difficulty](difficulty "wikilink") versions.

K

### Katu

<div id="Beat!">
</div>
Hit100k.png|Default skin for Katu (hit100k.png) Hit300k.png|Default skin for Katu (hit300k.png)

**Katu**, or "Beat!", is when you complete the [hitobject](hitobject "wikilink") with a [\#300](#300 "wikilink") (or [\#100](#100 "wikilink")), but the [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") wasn't done perfectly with [\#300](#300 "wikilink") for every [hitobject](hitobject "wikilink") (you got a [\#Miss](#Miss "wikilink"), [\#50](#50 "wikilink"), or [\#100](#100 "wikilink") somewhere within that combo).

### Keys

In [Mania](Mania "wikilink"), the number of **keys** can determine the map's [difficulty](difficulty "wikilink").

### Kiai

**Kiai** is a term given for a "special" [\#Timing section](#Timing_section "wikilink") to help emphasize a part of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). A player can tell if a part of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") has a **kiai** timing section by seeing added visual effects such as flashing [beats](Hit_Objects "wikilink"), flying stars, and fountains. Do note, abuse of **kiai** can be disorienting! Thus [mappers](mappers "wikilink") are advised to use it judiciously.

### Kudosu

**Kudosu** is the combination of the words "kudos" and "osu!". **Kudosu** is a rating system that rewards users that mod regularly. A [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") can award **kudosu** to a user that makes a constructive modding post. Accumulated **kudosu** can be used to increase a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink")'s priority rating. In depth information on the **kudosu** system can be found [here](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=10245).

L
-

### Lead-in

**Lead-in** is a 3 second time period of silence that might automatically be inserted before the beginning of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). This only happens if the [\#Beatmapper](#Beatmapper "wikilink") has placed [objects](object "wikilink") right at or very close at the start of the song.

### Life Bar

<div id="Health Bar>
</div>
<div id="HP Bar>
</div>
The **life bar**—also variously called the "health bar", "HP bar", "spirit bar", or "ki bar"—is a bar at the top left of the playing screen. There could be a symbol moving along it indicating the player's life. If the bar is completely empty, the player [\#Fails](#Fail "wikilink") the current [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") (assuming no special [game modifiers](game_modifiers "wikilink") are enabled). The bar drains at a constant rate throughout the course of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), except during a [\#Break](#Break "wikilink"). A sizeable part of the bar is also depleted in case of a [\#Miss](#Miss "wikilink"). The bar is replenished by the player [\#Tapping](#Tap "wikilink") [hit circles](hit_circle "wikilink"), following [sliders](sliders "wikilink") and [\#Slider Ticks](#Slider_Tick "wikilink"), and spinning [\#Spinners](#Spinner "wikilink"). The more accurate the tapping, the bigger the boost. The player also receives larger boosts if he achieves a [\#Katu](#Katu "wikilink") (Beat!) or an [\#Geki](#Geki "wikilink") (Elite Beat!) at the end of a [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink").

### Local Song Offset

The **local song offset** is an offset set for individual [\#Maps](#Map "wikilink"), not the [\#Mapset](#Mapset "wikilink") itself. This is to offset the [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink")'s offset alongside the global offset.

M
-

### M4M

**M4M**, or "**M**od *For* **M**od", is a term describing when a [\#Modder](#Modder "wikilink") agrees to mod another modder's map in return for a mod on their own map.

### MAX

  
*For [Mania](Mania "wikilink"), not to be confused with: [\#300](#300 "wikilink")*

Mania500.png|Default skin for mania-hit300g.png

In [Mania](Mania "wikilink"), **MAX** is a possible score for:

-   [\#Tapping](#Tap "wikilink") the key at the perfect time
-   Pressing and releasing the [\#Hold Note](#Hold_Note "wikilink") perfectly

**MAX** scores are needed to obtain a higher score in [Mania](Mania "wikilink") as they do give out the most points.

### Marathon

A **marathon** is a type of [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") that can only be [\#Approved](#Approved "wikilink"). **Marathon** [\#Maps](#Map "wikilink") must be at least 6 minutes long and can only have one [\#Mapped](#Mapped "wikilink") [\#Difficulty](#Difficulty "wikilink"); although, some [\#Mapsets](#Mapsets "wikilink") may contain a [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink") variant as well. **Marathon** [\#Beatmaps](#Beatmaps "wikilink") are sometimes [\#Collaborated](#Collab "wikilink") together due to the length of the music. Upon the creation of the **marathon** [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), one should name their [\#Map](#Map "wikilink") "**Marathon**" to bypass the [\#BSS](#BSS "wikilink") from preventing the [Pending](Pending "wikilink") status.

### MAT

  
*This term is to help preserve the history of the **MAT**s*

The **MAT** team—which is short for the **M**odding **A**ssistance **T**eam—was a group of users experienced in [modding](modding "wikilink"). **MAT** members can mark [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") they approve of with a [bubble](bubble "wikilink"), noting them as worthy of further consideration by the [\#BAT](#BAT "wikilink").

As of the April 23, 2013, all members of the **MAT** at that time were promoted as full members of the [\#BAT](#BAT "wikilink"), with the **MAT** team decommissioned.

### Miss

hit0.png|Default skin for hit0.png (Standard) taiko-hit0.png|Default skin for taiko-hit0.png (Taiko) mania0.png|Default skin for mania-hit0.png (Mania)

A **miss** is when the player fails to [\#Tap](#Tap "wikilink") a [hit circle](hit_circle "wikilink") on time by a large margin, not holding the cursor and/or pressing the button at one or more [\#Slider Ticks](#Slider_Tick "wikilink"), or failing to fill a [\#Spinner Metre](#Spinner_Metre "wikilink") within the allotted time. A **miss** causes a sizeable part of the [\#Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") to be depleted, prevents the player from getting an S, SS, Silver S or Silver S [\#Grade](#Grade "wikilink"). A **miss** will reset the [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink"), lowering the potential maximum score that can be achieved. **Misses** in the [\#DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") are represented by a red X.

### Modder

**Modder** is a term given to osu!players that gives comments or suggestions on another person's [\#Maps](#Maps "wikilink") in the forums.

Activities are shown either at \[//osu.ppy.sh/forum/10 Works In Progress\] (including the \[//osu.ppy.sh/forum/60 Modding Queues\]) and/or \[//osu.ppy.sh/forum/6 Pending Beatmaps\].

N

### NC

**NC** has two meanings:

1.  **N**ew **C**ombo, a modding term to suggest that a beat needs to be the start of a new [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink").
2.  **N**ight**c**ore [mod](Game_Modifiers "wikilink"), a variant of the double time mod that increases the pitch of the music and adds a consistent bass drum beat to the music.

### NM

**NM** is a term that stands for "**N**ormal **M**od". When a person wants a free mod from somewhere or just needs a mod any map they participated in, they may ask for one.

### Nuke

A [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") which, for various reasons, is currently extremely far from getting [ranked](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") and needs a particularly large number of modifications before it's even presentable. Examples include not following even the most basic of guidelines, such as having completely incorrect [\#Timing](#Timing "wikilink") or objects placed at random on the grid and/or timeline, but also \[//osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=2305&hilit=max+forever extremely challenging\] or unconventional beatmaps (e.g. consisting of a single [\#Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink")). The warning icon that accompanies Nuked beatmaps is the symbol for radioactive materials (![](Radioactive.gif "fig:Radioactive.gif")).

O
-

### Offset

The **offset** is a period of time between the beginning of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink")’s song file and the instant the first beat of the rhythm is heard, from which the position of the first [\#Beat](#Beat "wikilink") is calculated. This is measured in milliseconds (ms). The **offset** is the first half of [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") [\#Timing](#Timing "wikilink"), where the other half is the [\#BPM](#BPM "wikilink").

### osu!

**osu!** has three meanings:

1.  A rhythm video game for Microsoft Windows, based on certain [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink"). Spelled with a lowercase "o" and an exclamation mark.
2.  [osu!Standard](http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Standard), the game mode that osu! was originally based on.
3.  An informal greeting in the Japanese language, resulting from condensing the phrase "**O**hayo gozaima**su**!" (Good morning!) Pronounced with a silent u ("OSS"). Close English equivalents include "Yo!" or "Hey!". Read more about its meaning in Japanese language and culture [here](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2686#p2686).

### osu!coin

  
*[osu!academy](osu!academy "wikilink") introduces the **osu!coins**: \[//www.youtube.com/watch?v=BImc5McuK1o Introduction to **osu!coins**\]*

*[\#peppy](#peppy "wikilink") announces the **osu!coins**: \[//osu.ppy.sh/news/115118189213 osu!news\]*

The **osu!coin** was the ingame currency that was still "in development", as a 2015 April Fools joke.

After [\#peppy](#peppy "wikilink") realizes that the current rate of return wouldn't allow him to purchase a private jet within his lifetime, the **osu!coin** was introduced as the new ingame currency. Every player will start off with 10 **osu!coins** and will be given 10 **osu!coins** per day. Existing users will get an additional two **osu!coins** right off the bat.

One **osu!coin** will give the player one play, while retrying a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") will consume one **osu!coin**. If the player obtains a [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") that is a multiple of 100, they will obtain one **osu!coin**. If the player runs out of **osu!coins**, they may purchase more—out of their own will—with these exchange rates:

-   1USD = 1 **osu!coin**
-   10USD = 10 **osu!coins**
-   999USD = 1000 **osu!coins** (0.001% savings!)
-   first unborn child = infinite **osu!coins** (unborn child will work for [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink"))

The following day, [\#peppy](#peppy "wikilink") "Rollback **osu!coins** due to popular demand" and ends with this \[//disq.us/p/w2ydos remark\].

### osu!cookie

<div id="Cookie">

An **osupixel** represents one screen pixel when osu! is running in 640x480 resolution. **osupixels** are one of the main coordinate systems used in osu!, and apply to [\#Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") placement and [\#Storyboard](#Storyboard "wikilink") screen coordinates (these pixels are scaled over a 4:3 ratio to fit your screen).

In contrast, textures are scaled such that one texture pixel (\[//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texel\_%28graphics%29 texel\]) corresponds to one screen pixel at 1024x768 resolution.

### Ouendan

**Ouendan** has three meanings:

1.  In Japanese culture, a cheer squad which, similar to western cheerleaders, rallies a sports team on using drums, horns, banners and yells of encouragement.
2.  The pair of Japanese [\#DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") osu! is based on. Also sometimes used to refer specifically to the first of these games.
3.  A collective term for the playable characters in the aforementioned games, i.e. "The Ouendan".

### Overmap

**Overmapping** is when the [beats](Hit_Objects "wikilink") or placement of beats is placed in a way that makes the difficulty of the map contrast the actual song. This can be done by adding unnecessary [jumps](jumps "wikilink") or slider [speed-ups](Slider_Velocity_Changes "wikilink"), or by mapping to an unknown beat in the music consistently, in order to add difficulty (ie. Adding notes on blue ticks when the song is only using red ticks).

There are two ways to avoid this:

1.  [Jumps](Jumps "wikilink"), [Slider Speed-Ups](Slider_Speed-Ups "wikilink"), and other difficulty increasing techniques should only be used when they **fit with the music**. If there is no sudden change that requires (or could greatly be supplemented with) then simply don't add them. [Insane](Insane "wikilink") [\#Maps](#Maps "wikilink") are not to show how hard you can make a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), but rather how well you can make a map that is difficult but fun.
2.  The map might not need an [Insane](Insane "wikilink") [\#Difficulty](#Difficulty "wikilink"). If you feel that your map is too boring without adding a plethora of difficulty increasing techniques, then maybe your map does not need it. Remember, [\#Mapsets](#Mapset "wikilink") do not require a [Insane](Insane "wikilink") [\#Difficulty](#Difficulty "wikilink"), so you'll be just fine without one.

This topic was discussed in an episode of [osu!talk](osu!talk "wikilink") (\[//www.youtube.com/watch?v=RepSYE3hN3A discussions (episode 2)\]) that **overmapping** actually has a positive effect in [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink") maps. This was observed since the drums is the beat of the song.

### Pass

**Pass** is the completion of a beatmap without [\#Failing](#Fail "wikilink") or using [mods](Game_Modifiers "wikilink") that prevent failing.

### peppy

**peppy**', written with the first letter in lowercase, is the online alias of "Dean Herbert". He is the creator and primary (read: only) developer of the code and sprites that make [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") tick.

### Play Time

  
*Not to be confused with: [\#Drain Time](#Drain_Time "wikilink")*

**Play time** is the total duration of a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), including the [\#Lead-in](#Lead-in "wikilink") time and the [\#Break](#Break "wikilink") time(s).

### puush

**puush** is a screen capturing and file uploading application developed by [\#peppy](#peppy "wikilink"). **puush** is a successor of sorts to [\#upppy](#upppy "wikilink") which is commonly used to upload and share images in [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink"). **puush** can be found [here](http://puush.me/).

Q
-

### QAT

**QAT** members are the ones responsible for ensuring that beatmaps will remain playable and enjoyable.

### Qualify

<div id="Qualified">
</div>
A [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") is [**Qualified**](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist&s=4&r=11) if it has gone through extensive [modding](modding "wikilink") and the [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") has been nominated for [\#Ranking](#Ranking "wikilink"), but have not been [\#Ranked](#Rank "wikilink") yet. The [\#QAT](#QAT "wikilink") is responsible for moving qualified beatmaps into the [\#Ranked](#Rank "wikilink") category, or [\#Disqualifying](#Disqualifying "wikilink") the beatmap.

R

### Rank

  
*For Ranked beatmaps see [Ranked beatmap](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink").*

i) Another word for a [grade](#Grade "wikilink").
ii) A player’s standing in the online leaderboard (a.k.a Player [Rankings](#Ranking "wikilink")).
iii) Verb, "to rank", i.e. to second another moderator’s nomination and include a submitted [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to the Ranked Beatmap list, making scores achieved by anyone playing it count towards each player’s Ranking. Getting their beatmaps ranked is a goal of every beatmapper.

### Ranking

Alternatively called Leaderboard. A list which sorts members of the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community according to certain criteria. Can also refer to one's position in such a list. osu! currently has three Rankings: i) Player Rankings: the Ranking most commonly referred to, this list sorts players depending on their Ranked Score. Ranked Score is the sum of the highest score a player has achieved in every [ranked](ranked "wikilink") [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") he has played. Only [scores](Score "wikilink") achieved after the beatmap is ranked are taken into account. Only one score from each beatmap (the highest) is taken into account, regardless of how many difficulty versions it has. ii) Beatmapper Rankings: This list sorts everyone who has created at least one ranked beatmap, depending on the weighted average of all the ratings given to their beatmaps by other players, multiplied by a bonus modifier that increases the more ranked beatmaps they have. iii) Moderator Rankings: This list sorts moderators depending on how many posts they have made in the Beatmap sub-forums, i.e. how much beatmap [modding](modding "wikilink") they are doing.

### Recalc

Recalculate [Slider](Slider "wikilink") Lengths. A command under the Timing header of the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") screen. Select it when a change in [BPM](BPM "wikilink") is made after Sliders have been placed. This command will try to automatically adjust the length of every Slider in the [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to the new BPM. After choosing this command, especially if a large change in BPM has been made, it is important to check every Slider and adjust its length manually where necessary.

### Resnap

A pair of commands under the [Timing](#Timing "wikilink") header of the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") screen, one of which applies to the entire [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") and the other to the current [timing section](#Timing_section "wikilink") (if the beatmap has only one timing section, both commands are the same). Select when there has been a change in [offset](#Offset "wikilink") and/or [BPM](BPM "wikilink") after [objects](#Object "wikilink") have been placed. This command will try to automatically reposition all objects on the timeline so that they fall on the closest [beat](#Beat "wikilink") division your [Snap Divisor](Beat_Snap_Divisor "wikilink") allows. After choosing this command, especially if a large change in BPM and/or offset has been made, it is important to check every object and adjust its position on the timeline manually where necessary.

### RSI

**R**epetitive **S**train **I**njury, a disorder that affects the musculoskeletal and nervous system of the body. It can be caused by repetitive tasks in awkward positions, including playing osu! for an extended amount of time.

### Sample Set

A collection of sound effects that are heard during gameplay. People can use custom sample sets for their [beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink"). Apart from the default sound made when [tapping](#Tap "wikilink") a [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), the most well known elements in a sample set are the [Whistle](#Whistle "wikilink") and the [Finish](#Finish "wikilink"). Other parts of a sample set include the Slider Tick sounds and the sound made when filling the [Spinner Metre](#Spinner_Metre "wikilink").

### Skin

A set of graphics and custom [sample sets](#Sample_Set "wikilink") that can be chosen to replace the default ones used by [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") in order to customise one's playing experience. Most of what you see and hear in osu! can be skinned. There is [a sub-forum dedicated to skins](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=15).

### Sliderbreak

The loss of [combo](#combo "wikilink") from not holding a slider long enough, going out of the slider circle or not hitting the beginning of the slider (but within the follow circle of the slider). This will give a score of 100 or 50 for the note, depending on how much slider ticks are missed. Unlike [Missing](#Miss "wikilink"), you can still achieve an "S" rank after sliderbreaking.

### Song packs

Collections of [ranked beatmaps](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") that can be downloaded by file sharing services. Most song packs are sets of beatmaps that were ranked during the same time period, but in other packs contain songs of a similar style or theme. You can find song packs [here](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=1853).

### Spectate

"Spec" for short. To watch another playing a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") in real time (approx. 500 ms delay). To spectate, open [Extended Chat](#Extended_Chat "wikilink") mode and click on a grey user panel. You need to have a copy of the exact same beatmap the person you wish to spectate is playing.

### Spinner

One of three [objects](#Object "wikilink") the player interacts with (the other two being the [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") and the [Slider](Slider "wikilink")) and probably the one seen least often. A Spinner is a circle that takes up the entire height of the play area and has a [Spinner Metre](#Spinner_Metre "wikilink") on either side. A large circular outline similar to a [Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink") appears on the Spinner’s border and gradually converges on its centre. The player should hold the mouse button down and spin in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. As long as the mouse button is held down, the cursor is locked on the Spinner’s area, so the player need not worry about going outside it. The Spinner is cleared if all the levels of the Spinner Metre are filled before its Approach Circle reaches the centre. Depending on the difficulty settings of each [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), a different number of spins are required to fill each level of the Spinner Metre (worth 100 points). If the player fills the Spinner Metre before the Approach Circle reaches the Spinner’s centre, each additional spin before time runs out will award the player with 1000 bonus points (each receiving a bonus multiplier depending on the player’s current [Combo](Combo "wikilink")). Spinning a Spinner provides a continuous minor boost to the [Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") depending on the spinning speed.

### Spinner Metre

A pair of bars on either side of a [Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink") which typically gradually fill up with colour as the player spins the Spinner. In order to clear the spinner, all levels of the Spinner Metre should light up before the [Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink") reaches the Spinner's centre. Each level that lights up on the Spinner Metre awards the player with 100 points (regardless of [Combo](#Combo "wikilink")).

### Spinner Spam

To overuse [Spinners](#Spinner "wikilink") in a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). There are many kinds of Spinner Spam: Using very long Spinners (lasting more than 10 seconds or so), using a lot of very short Spinners (lasting less than 2 seconds or so) one after the other, or even worse, using a lot of regular sized or long Spinners one after the other. With the possible exception of some especially challenging beatmaps, Spinner Spam is to be avoided for the following reasons: i) A Spinner is by far the gameplay element that causes the player the most fatigue, since it requires rapid, repetitive, vigorous motion. A lot of Spinners or even a single long one can easily tire a player’s arm. ii) Due to the circular, often frantic motion required to clear it, after clearing a spinner the player’s cursor is often left at a random position in the screen, possibly far from an incoming [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") or [Slider](Slider "wikilink"). A multitude of Spinners will thus be particularly disorienting for most players.

### Stacked

[Objects](#Object "wikilink") that overlap each other in the play field. Most common in [Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), less common with Hit Circles and the edges of [sliders](Slider "wikilink") to be avoided with any other combination of objects. Stacking Hit Circles, while a clear violation of [Beat Spacing](#Beat_Spacing "wikilink"), is nevertheless permitted if the Hit Circles are very close to each other in the timeline (half a [beat](#Beat "wikilink") or usually even less).

### Standard Submission

A way to submit a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") through the [BSS](#BSS "wikilink") system, making it available to the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community. Standard Submission is the one used when first uploading a beatmap, as well as when updating with changes such as [object](#Object "wikilink") placement, tweaks in [timing](#Timing "wikilink"), custom colour schemes, new difficulty versions etc. Every Standard Submission of a beatmap after the first is faster because only the changes are uploaded.

### Star

i) A stage in a beatmap’s [modding](Modding "wikilink") process where a moderator judges a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to be on the right track but needing some improvements before he approves of it with a [bubble](bubble "wikilink"). Examples include adjustments in [timing](#Timing "wikilink"), incorrect [Beat Spacing](#Beat_Spacing "wikilink") in some areas, or creating additional difficulty versions. Beatmaps receiving a star are denoted by a star graphic next to their thread’s title. A star may be removed by another mod if he judges the beatmap to need a rather larger amount of improvements than expected.
ii) Can be used as a shortened form of [difficulty](Difficulty "wikilink") stars.

### Star Priority

**Star Priority** is a method of helping [BNs](BN "wikilink") find beatmaps worthy of [bubbling](Beatmap_approval#Bubble "wikilink") and later [ranking](Beatmap_approval#Ranked "wikilink"). The Star Priority of a beatmap is determined by how many [mod posts](Modding "wikilink") that have gained kudosu in the beatmap's thread, the sum of kudosu stars the map set has received. A kudosu star can be given by any user to any map, though shooting a kudosu star comes at the price of one [kudosu](kudosu "wikilink"). The conversion rate was formerly three kudosu for one kudosu star that increased the Star Priority by two.

The higher the star priority, the higher the beatmap's thread appears in the Works in Progress or Pending subforum. At least 12 star priority is needed for a map to be bubbled or ranked.

### Storyboard

A set of still images, animated images and sound effects that tells a story during a [beatmap|beatmap’s](#Beatmap "wikilink") course but especially before the beatmap’s beginning, during [breaks](#Break "wikilink") and after the beatmap’s end. In the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink"), Storyboards concern one or more persons facing a difficult challenge or predicament which they then try to overcome whilst being cheered on by the player-controlled characters to the tune of a song. Therefore, a Storyboard can take various directions depending on the player’s performance. [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") storyboarding is supported through the use of a scripting language or the [Storyboard Editor](Storyboard_Editor "wikilink") which can be accessed in [Editor](Editor "wikilink") Mode under "Design". There is [a sub-forum dedicated to Storyboards](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=20).

### Storyboard Editor

Can be found under "Design" in [Editor](Editor "wikilink") mode. As the name implies, [storyboards](Storyboarding "wikilink") can be easily created and edited here.

### Stream

A long series of [objects](#Object "wikilink"), not necessarily belonging in a single [Combo](Combo "wikilink"), which appear in rapid succession. Also see [Deathstream](#Deathstream "wikilink").

### SV

Slider Velocity, the speed in which the slider moves at in relation to the BPM

### TAG2/TAG3/TAG4

Tag difficulties are difficulties that are designed for tag cooperation in multi-play mode. Since each player is responsible for one combo in one turn only, each combo can be separated extremely far, making it nearly impossible to play by a single player, and therefore it becomes a challenge for elite players in terms of precision of jumping. [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/87570&m=0 Example](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/87570&m=0_Example "wikilink")

TAG difficulties are usually named TAG in a beatmap set. TAG2 maps are meant for 2 players while TAG4 maps (the hardest) are meant for 4 players.

Note that tag difficulties are unrankable because they are far too hard to be ranked and are not designed for a single player.

### Tablet

A graphics tablet, an alternative input medium to the computer mouse. A tablet consists of a flat surface on which one can point and drag using an attached stylus. The image of the screen does not appear on the tablet, thus making it different in functionality from a [Touch screen](#Touch_screen "wikilink").

### Tap

To press a button while the cursor is over a [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"). Tapping Hit Circles at the right moment, as indicated by the [beatmap’s](#Beatmap "wikilink") music and the [Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink"), is an essential part of [osu](osu "wikilink")! gameplay. There are many buttons one can use to tap: either mouse button, the z and x keys on the keyboard (see [z/x](#z/x "wikilink")), either button on a [Touchpad](#Touchpad "wikilink"), buttons on a [Tablet’s](#Tablet "wikilink") pen, etc.

### Test Build

A [Build](#Build "wikilink") usually updated at least daily with up-to-date improvements in the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") application. Its [Updater](#Updater "wikilink") is available to moderators and other willing beta testers upon request. All working changes in the Test Builds are eventually made available in a new version of the [Public Build](#Public_Build "wikilink").

### Test Mode

A feature at the beatmap editor to test a [Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") (nothing submitted).

### Time signature

A musical term indicating how many [beats](#Beat "wikilink") are in each measure and what note value constitutes a single beat. [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") offers two alternative time signatures, which can be selected from the [Timing](#Timing "wikilink") menu: 4/4, which is the one most commonly used, and 3/4, which is selected when the rhythm of the song is of, or similar to, a waltz.

### Timing

Probably the most important requirement for a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to get [ranked](ranked "wikilink"), as well as the most difficult to accomplish. Timing a beatmap consists of determining the [offset](#Offset "wikilink") and then the [BPM](BPM "wikilink") of the song it uses. On songs where the tempo changes, this needs to be done for every [timing section](#Timing_section "wikilink"). The timing process creates the timeline on which [objects](#Object "wikilink") will be placed. Without perfect timing, or at least close enough that the human ear can't tell the difference, it is next to impossible to place objects to the rhythm of the music, which is the entire point of [osu!](#osu! "wikilink")

### Timing section

A part of a song which follows a different rhythm than the parts preceding and following it. Many songs have a constant tempo and thus a single timing section, but for those which have more, the beatmapper needs to identify any areas where the song [BPM](BPM "wikilink") and/ or [time signature](#Time_Signature "wikilink") changes and find the [timing](#Timing "wikilink") for each one. Timing sections can also be used even if the rhythm of the song remains constant throughout the beatmap, for example in order to allow the beatmapper to assign different [sample sets](#Sample_Set "wikilink") to different parts of the song. Those are called "inherited timing sections" and are identified by green lines.

### Touch screen

One of the input mediums used by the Nintendo DS and the sole input medium for the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") is based on. Osu! supports Touch screen functionality, but the hardware required is generally expensive for the average player. A computer whose entire screen functions as a Touch screen is called a Tablet PC (Do not confuse with [Tablet](#Tablet "wikilink")).

### Touchpad

A substitute for the computer mouse found on laptop computers. A small rectangular area on which one can drag one’s finger to move the mouse cursor. Due to the way touchpads are designed, they do not work with a stylus or similar devices.

U
-

### Universal Offset

The time delay between a) the [object](#Object "wikilink") graphics and [sample set](#Sample_Set "wikilink") sounds associated with them and b) the point of the song where they should be heard. Universal Offset applies to all songs used in [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") and its value differs according to each system's specifications. After being determined, it doesn't need to be modified again. Incorrectly set Universal Offset causes [timing](#Timing "wikilink") problems in every [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") played or edited. If everything sounds off to you while playing a [ranked](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), try checking your Universal Offset. Universal Offset is set from the Options Menu.

### Updater

The osume.exe file, which, when run, will check whether there have been updates to the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") [build](#Build "wikilink") you are using and download and install any such updates. There are two Updaters - one for the [Public Build](#Public_Build "wikilink") and one for the [Test Build](#Test_Build "wikilink").

### upppy

A fast and easy-to-use uploading service coded by [peppy](peppy "wikilink"). If you want to share a file with the [osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community, forget about depositing it on Rapidshare, Megaupload, ImageShack and the like - put it on upppy and everyone's happy! :) You can find it [here](http://up.ppy.sh).

W

### Whistle

A sound effect, part of a [sample set](#Sample_Set "wikilink"), usually reserved for emphasizing and punctuating certain points in a song. Its default form and icon in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") is that of a blown whistle.

### WIP

Acronym for Work In Progress, a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") that is, for one reason or another, deemed incomplete by its creator (e.g. incomplete difficulty versions, only one difficulty version, pending correction or suggestions on the timing etc.) WIPs can be submitted through the [BSS](#BSS "wikilink") to the Beatmap Help forum to get comments, feedback and help from [mods](Modding "wikilink") and other users.

Z
-

### z/x

To use the z and x keyboard keys to [tap](#Tap "wikilink") in [osu!](#osu! "wikilink"). A very popular alternative to the left and right mouse buttons. During gameplay, while z is pressed, the left mouse button will not work and vice versa. The same applies to the x key and the right mouse button. This can be changed in the options menu.
