# Hyperdash

A *hyperdash* is the term used in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) for the movement which is done when a [hyperfruit](/wiki/Hit_object/Hyperfruit) is generated. When modding a beatmap people tend to link the hyperfruit and the target [active object](/wiki/Glossary/Active_object) (e.g. `00:01:000 (1,2) - ` where 1 is the hyperfruit and 2 the target active object).
