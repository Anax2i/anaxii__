Introduction
============

I've never played this "Ouendan" thing - what is it?
----------------------------------------------------

[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan) is a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS. The gameplay consists of only three elements: tapping circles on the touchscreen, dragging a ball across a fixed path and rotating a spinner very fast. All these elements are timed to (covers of) popular Japanese songs. It looks like this on the DS:

![](Ouendan.jpg "Ouendan.jpg")

You can see the circles on the bottom screen, and on the top screen you have the story. Each stage is basically a self-contained story about a person in trouble. That's where the Ouendan (Cheer squad) comes in. Through the magical power of male cheer-leading, you have to help the people in trouble.

How do I play?
--------------

  
*Full explanation: [osu! Standard](Standard "wikilink")*

While most PC users won't have a touchscreen at their disposal, this game is made to be playable with a normal mouse, as well as any number of input devices you can possibly think of. Different play styles can be found in the [Play Styles](Play_Styles "wikilink") page. There are some songs which push the limits of the normal mouse (and you), but all the (ranked and approved) beatmaps have been tested and (most can be) passable using only a mouse.

### Game-play Basics

`Tutorial: `[`(Bundled` `with` `PC` `osu!)` `Original` `tutorial`](http://osu.ppy.sh/s/3756)`, `[`Ranked` `beatmap` `version`](http://osu.ppy.sh/s/19928)

The game-play puts emphasis on your:

-   Adaptability and reaction to stimuli (that is, the hit-able objects appearing all over the screen at lightning speed).
-   Understanding of the song beat and design.
-   Your control of your mouse (or your fingers/pen-poking skills if you are using a tablet instead).
-   Timing of your hits on the object that appeared on the screen.
-   Ability to spin the mouse (or your finger/pen for tablet) on spinners.
-   Your physical stamina (especially marathon songs).
-   Proper mouse positioning and hand-eye coordination.
-   Your hardware capability (especially your mouse/tablet).

These are some of the vital skills you will learn as you progress your journey on becoming an osu! rhythm master. Before you set out to become a rhythm master, you must learn the basics (and theories) of the hit-able objects.

Let's learn about what the hit-able objects are, shall we?

#### Hit-circles

<img src="Hitcircles.jpg" title="Hitcircles.jpg" alt="Hitcircles.jpg" width="400" height="300" />

-   Here you can see the circles you have to tap.
    -   The smaller coloured approach circle on the outside shrinks and you have to hit the note at the exact point when it touches the white border of hit-circle.
-   To understand the hidden charm of hit-circles, you should not only rely on your perception (your eyes) but also the understanding of the beatmaps' beats and rhythm by your ears (auditory).

#### Sliders

<img src="Slider.jpg" title="Slider.jpg" alt="Slider.jpg" width="400" height="300" />

-   Here we have a slider.
    -   First, you have to hit it at the right moment, but it doesn't end there.
    -   A ball will start to move across the path you see.
    -   You have to hold the mouse/keyboard-button (or your finger/pen on the tablet) and keep your pointer inside the thick orange circle surrounding the ball as it moves.
        -   You cannot control the movement, and you must follow its movement.
        -   The orange circle will appear if you are holding it and disappears when you leave it.
    -   Sometimes, as in the screenshot above, you have to move back at the end of the path.
    -   You can tell by the reverse symbol at the end of the path.

#### Spinners

<img src="Spinner.jpg" title="Spinner.jpg" alt="Spinner.jpg" width="400" height="300" />

-   This is a spinner.
    -   You have to click then hold the hit-button, and the mouse is used to spin (clockwise or counter-clockwise) in circles like mad before the time (which is, that blue circle line) runs out.
        -   The bars on the outside indicate how close you are to passing.
        -   The small bar below the spinner shows spins per minute, means the number of spins you are making if you continue that speed of spinning for one minute.
        -   If you didn't hold any hit-button prior to spinning, you will not fill up the gauge at all.
-   On the DS, this is a good way to scratch your touchscreen (or screen protectors), especially on the higher difficulties.
-   In osu!, spinners have been toned down as to not be such a nuisance to complete.
    -   The maximum number of spins per minute achievable is 477 which is also the rate at which the Auto game modifier spins while the Spun Out game modifier spins slower at 287 spins per minute.
-   \[Mouse\]**If your cursor did not spin at all but moving statically despite you are spinning really fast, either understand the limit of your mouse or get a better mouse/mousepad**.
    -   Conventional mouse may suffer this issue, and it is best to **start spinning slowly instead of suddenly spinning really fast** so that the mouse can detect what you are doing.

### In-Game Interface

![](Hierophobicintro.jpg "Hierophobicintro.jpg")

This is the osu! game style interface.

-   The top left bar is your "health".
    -   This will decrease at a steady rate \[depending on the beatmap difficulty set by the mapper(s)\], but you can replenish it by hitting notes at the right time.
    -   A perfectly timed hit (300 hit or Geki Beat) will increase your health more than a badly timed hit (50 hit).
    -   A total miss will take a good chunk out of your health.
-   Next to the health bar (at the right) is your score.
-   Below the score is your accuracy.
-   The circle beside your accuracy and below your score is a timer bar, which shows the song length.
-   The number on the bottom left is the combo counter/score multiplier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternative Game Modes
======================

What is "Taiko"?
----------------

  
*Full explanation: [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink")*

[200px|thumb|right|Taiko gameplay.](image:taiko.jpg "wikilink") *[Taiko no Tatsujin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin)* is a Taiko Drum rhythm game made by Namco, that involves the simulation of playing the drums to the beat of the music. In osu!, beatmaps can be played in the styling of Taiko no Tatsujin through the use of special Taiko game mode.

Like basic osu!, there are three elements of gameplay.

### Basic explanation

<u>**Hit-circles**</u>
This will appear as either a red or a pale-blue circle. They are named as red (Don) notes and blue (Katu) notes.

-   If it is a small red note, you must press the button bound to the inner portion of the Taiko drum or hit the large flat area (center) of the TaTaCon.
-   If it is a small blue note, you must press the button bound to the outer ring of the Taiko drum or hit the sides of the TaTaCon.
-   If the note is a LARGE circle, you should press or hit both of either inner or outer drum depending on the colour of the note for additional points.
    -   The notes must be pressed or hit when they reach the small white circle next to the drum below the status bar on the play-field.

<u>**Hit balloons**</u>
They are shown as normal small red notes but with a inflatable balloon behind it.

-   You should hit the inner drum continuously until the hit counter reaches zero.
-   You gain points for each hit and bonus points for popping the balloon.

<u>**Drum rolls**</u>
Drum rolls appears as yellow bar in the play-field.

-   You should hit the inner (or outer) drum continuously until it is done.
    -   For LARGE note, you should hit both buttons on the inner (or outer) drum simultaneously and continuously until it is done.
-   You gain points for each successful hits.
-   You can choose to ignore it at the cost of your possible points gained from the drum roll.

<u>**Dendens**</u>
These appear as spinners, with a countdown displaying the time you have remaining to clear it.

-   You must hit the inner and outer drum in order (like red,red, blue,blue, red,red, and so on) until the Denden meter is full.
-   Bonus points are given for extra hits after completing the Denden.

### Controls

The default controls for the Taiko mod are:

`Red: [Mouse] Left click, [Keyboard] [X] or [C], [TaTaCon] Flat surface of the drum.`
`Blue: [Mouse] Right click, [Keyboard] [Z] or [V], [TaTaCon] Outer surface of the drum.`
`osu! cursor placement does not matter when playing.`

You may configure the keyboard buttons as you see fit, from the Input tab in the Options menu.

What is "Catch the Beat"?
-------------------------

[200px|thumb|right|Catch the Beat gameplay.](image:ctbaqua.jpg "wikilink")

  
*Full explanation: [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink")*

Catch the Beat is the second special game mode to be added in, after Taiko game mode.
Instead of clicking circles, you are now tasked to move the catcher at the bottom of the screen while the fruits fall from above.

### Controlling the catcher

  
If the [Relax](Relax "wikilink") mod is used, control of the catcher is done by moving the mouse instead.

-   By default, the left \[&lt;-\] and right \[-&gt;\] arrow keys are used to move the catcher.
-   Pressing the left \[SHIFT\] key with one of the arrow keys will make the catcher dash in that direction at x1.5 speed (indicated by a bright glow at the catcher).

What is "osu!mania"?
--------------------

![ thumb | 200px | osu!mania (7K) gameplay.]( Mania screenshot.jpg  " thumb | 200px | osu!mania (7K) gameplay.")

  
*Full explanation: [osu!mania](Osu!mania "wikilink")*

osu!mania is the third special game mode to be added in, after Taiko and CtB game mode.
This mode has been widely used in almost all of the major rhythm games that require good hand/leg coordination, where the beat notes with their quantity depending on BPM and difficulty move on the conveyer, and the player have to press the correct key for that specific beat note in time. Though the game mode was originally made as an imitation of Beatmania style of playing, however, by changing the number of keys, you can make it look more like Guitar Hero (5) or Dance Dance Revolution (4) and so on.
Currently, you can set from 1 to 9 Key by game modifier (by default, it would be around 4 to 8 Key, except for osu!mania-specific beatmaps) to an upward of 2 - 18 Key (two playfield) with the [Co-op](COOP "wikilink") game modifier.

### Controls

<img src="Mania Key Bind.png" title="fig:[Symmetrical]Key Bind colour and placement by number of buttons (outdated)" alt="[Symmetrical]Key Bind colour and placement by number of buttons (outdated)" width="200" /> There two different binding-styles, *Symmetrical* and *Left to Right*.

-   *Symmetrical* style mimics the button placement of DJMAX, in which the center key is "spacebar", in which, created a feeling of "stepping" the pedal similar to the arcade version. Centre key matches the middle column (5K and 7K only) and the other column matches the keys in its corresponding place.
-   *Left to Right* style mimics the button placement of Beatmania IIDX, where the first column matches to the key1, then the second column matches the key2 and so on.

*Symmetrical* key binding (For DJMAX style)

-   For *left* hand buttons — (K1)**A**, (K2)**S**, (K3)**D**, (K4)**F**
-   For *right* hand buttons — (K6)**J**, (K7)**K**, (K8)**L**, (K9)**semicolon ";"**.
-   *Center* button — (K5)**spacebar**. \[On 5K and 7K only\]
-   The *Special* button — **left SHIFT** and **left control "Ctrl"**.

*Left to Right* key binding (For Beatmania IIDX style)

-   From down to up then down to up again: (K1)**Z**, (K2)**S**, (K3)**X**, (K4)**D**, (K5)**C**, (K6)**F**, (K7)**V**, (K8)**G**, (K9)**B** \[K9 is not used\]
-   The *Special* button — **left SHIFT** and **left control "Ctrl"**.

Performance Points
------------------

  
*Full explanation: [Performance Points](Performance_Points "wikilink")*

Performance Points (pp) is a ranking metric aiming to be more contextually relevant to a continuous game like osu!. It aims to shift the focus from being on the amount of time played to the actual skill of the player. Performance points are heavily based on map difficulty which is determined by a unique algorithm in every gamemode. Based on this difficulty alone each of your scores is rated and assigned a pp value. Your performance rank is predominantly based on your performance on individual maps. The easiest way to improve it is to improve your scores on difficult songs. Do note that game modes are counted separately \[which means, playing (osu!/Taiko/CtB/osu!mania) raises (osu!/Taiko/CtB/osu!mania) pp\].
If you have any questions regarding pp, please refer to the [wiki page for pp first](Performance_Points#FAQ "wikilink").

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common issues and questions
===========================

General
-------

### Where can I find and get the beatmaps?

  
*Detailed explanation of the beatmaps: [Beatmaps](Beatmaps "wikilink")*

You can find it from the main page under the name "[Beatmaps](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist)".

-   Just remember to log in to your osu! account before-hand or the server treats you as a guest and prohibit you from downloading beatmaps from the site.

### Can I disable Kiai Time?

No, because unlike video, they are integrated to the game (as a part with the hit objects), thus cannot be disabled.

### The maps are too hard! Where can I find some easier maps?

Pokebis has compiled a set of beatmaps suitable for beginners to play. You can find them here: <http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/5456>

Also, [the ranked beatmap version of osu! tutorial](http://osu.ppy.sh/s/19928) is good for practicing some of the possible mapping design you will come across. It's an excellent training map for newbies and experienced players.

Alternatively, you can [sort the ranked beatmap list by difficulty](http://osu.ppy.sh/?p=beatmaplist&s=3). The easiest maps are at the top of the list.

### What does Level in my profile actually do?

Absolutely nothing. There is no difference in any way when comparing a Level 100 player against a Level 1 player except the player's own skills and experience of play. There is no handicap for the lower level nor there is an advantage for the higher level (except personal experience and hardware used).

Level is based on your total score accumulated when online with your account whether you pass or fail the beatmap. [Formula given here](Score#Level "wikilink")

### Why is my profile stats different ingame?

Keep in mind that osu! has four game modes so you might be looking at the wrong game mode.

Manually select the game mode at your profile that you want to view.

![](Profile_Mode_Buttons.gif "Profile_Mode_Buttons.gif")

### Why am I seeing random white lines on screen every time I play?

Make sure that the smoke/skywriting key binding is not the same as the keybinding you use at playing.

<File:Smoke> effect.jpg| Usage of "Smoke" <File:Screenshot085.jpg>| Location of "Smoke"

### Why do I not have the max possible combo when I have no misses?

You released a slider too early or you barely clicked the hit-circle. [Answer's Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/wiki/index)

Performance points questions
----------------------------

Credit: CXu's Performance Points FAQ [1](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/p/4587984)

### Why did I only gain 30pp when the map I played gives 100pp?

PP is a weighted system. This means that your highest pp score gives 100% of its pp, the next one 95% and so on. So your 100pp score may only be weighted around 30%. This does not, however, mean that you actually get a 100% pp gain, even if you set a new personal top performance, as every other score you have will be weighted less than they did before. It's quite easy if you think about it for a little bit:
Let's imagine that your top rank only has 2 maps and looks like this:
**\#1.** 100pp, weighted 100%
**\#2.** 100pp, weighted 95%
Your total pp will then be 100 + 95 = 195pp. If you now set a 110pp score, your top rank will look like this:
**\#1.** 110pp, weighted 100%
**\#2.** 100pp, weighted 95%
**\#3.** 100pp, weighted 90%
As you can see, your new total pp is not 195 + 110 = 305pp, but 110 + 95 + 90 = 295pp.

### I used to get some pp from playing 100pp maps, but now I get nothing?

This happens for the same reason as above. At some point, the score will be weighted for 1% or less, and your overall net gain of pp will be so small that it's negligible. Set some scores worth more pp to gain more!

### I played a map and I suddenly lost 384495 ranks! Why did I lose so much pp?

Are you absolutely sure you lost pp? Remember that a ranking is dynamic. When you go to bed, countless of people below you will play the game and achieve a higher pp score than you. Your rank does not update until you play a song, so when you play a song, and get to the result screen, it will look like you suddenly lost a lot of ranks. In reality, this most likely happened not because you lost pp, but because other players gained pp, either while you were busy playing the map, or while you were busy doing other things.

### I just got a new score on a map, and I lost pp for it. Why isn't the highest pp score saved?

osu! is a fairly old game, and back then, pp didn't exist, and score rankings were the alpha and omega. And while we do have a pp based ranking now, map ranking are still determined by the player with the highest score, and not the highest pp, and therefore you might occasionally lose pp from getting a higher combo with worse accuracy, or playing with HD with worse accuracy or similar.

### Why is x mod over-/underweighted? This is wrong!

Almost every "mod specialist" that keep talking about mods being over or underrated falls into either category:

1.  Those that think their mod is underrated and the others are overrated (because "if I had x I would totally pp farm that stuff while I'm totally pro.")
2.  Those that think their mod is overrated and the others are underrated (because "rofl this is soooooooooooooo easy I'm so good at this game.")

In reality, no system can be completely perfect. Some maps will be easier than others, while still give the same amount of pp, and that's just how it is. Difficulty is also subjective, and it depends heavily on what you as a player specialize in. A HR player might find a particular map overweighted with HR, while a nomod player might find that pp weighed perfectly fine.

### Why is x map over-/underweighted? This is wrong!

This has more or less the same answer as above. Additionally, the pp algorithm currently does not really take reading difficulty into account. This means that maps that are difficult to read will very often be underweighted compared to their overall difficulty.

### How do I get more pp?

Play more.

Beatmapping
-----------

### "This beatmap you're trying to submit isn't owned by you!"

  
*For unranked beatmaps only.*

Please follow these steps:

  
1. Leave the editor (or close osu!) to make sure the changes apply properly

2. Check the name of the beatmap's folder

:\* If it starts with numbers, remove them. Otherwise, osu! will treat it as BeatmapSetID

3. Make sure that the .mp3 does not start with numbers. Edit the filename in the .osu files if it does.

4. Open all the .osu files with a text editor (Notepad will work)

:\*Set your name as creator (and replace it in the file name as well)

:\*Set the BeatmapID to 0

:\*Set the BeatmapSetID to -1
