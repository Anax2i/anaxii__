#### All

##### Special grades

- Silver SS (SSH) = Normal grade SS with *[Hidden](/wiki/Hidden)* and/or *[Flashlight](/wiki/Flashlight)* mod.
- Silver S  (SH)  = Normal grade S  with *[Hidden](/wiki/Hidden)* and/or *[Flashlight](/wiki/Flashlight)* mod.

##### Saving ranked plays

- Grades obtained will be set in the profile page under Ranks when passing a ranked beatmap while signed in to the game.
  - Offline play will not be counted.
- Grades given for profile depends on ranked top score grade for a beatmap's difficulty in that game mode, not as whole.
  - If a beatmap has three ranked difficulties, and SS'ed all three of them in osu!catch; three SS will be given for osu!catch's Ranks section, not just one SS given.
  - However, if a new highscore (from better spinner bonus or game modifiers) was achieved from replaying an SS'ed ranked difficulty but was an S grade, then the SS counter will decrement by one and S counter increment by one instead.

## Performance Points

*Main page: [Performance Points](/wiki/Performance_Points)*

*For any questions regarding pp, see: [FAQ/Performance_Points](/wiki/Performance_Points#FAQ)*

Performance points(pp) is a ranking metric aiming to be more contextually relevant to a continuous game like osu!. It aims to shift the focus from being on the amount of time played to the actual skill of the player. Performance points is heavily based on map difficulty, determined by a unique algorithm in every game mode. Based on this difficulty alone, each of the scores will be rated and assigned a pp value. Performance rank is predominantly based on performance on individual maps.

The easiest way to improve it is to score high on difficult songs, and playing more songs. Do note that game modes are counted separately; playing osu!standard, osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania will raise the pp for the respective game mode.

## General

**Where do I find and download beatmaps?**

*For a detailed explanation of beatmaps, see: [Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps)*

In the website, navigate under *[beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets)*. Just remember to sign in with beforehand to allow downloading and searching beatmaps.

**Can I disable Kiai Time?**

**No**, because unlike video, it is integrated to the game (as a part with the hit objects), thus cannot be disabled.

**The maps are too hard! Where can I find some easier maps?**

These are some guides in the forums for beginners in every game mode.

- [Beginner's Training](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/5456): an osu!standard guide suitable for beginners to play by **Pokebis**.
- [TBT Project [Training Manual For Taiko Beginner v2]](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/175867): an osu!taiko guide for beginners to learn osu!taiko by **OnosakiHito**.
- [CBT Project [Catch the Beat Beginner Tutorial]](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/131067): an osu!catch guide with a nice list of osu!catch beatmaps and basic explanation about osu!catch by **Kingkevin30**.
- [osu!mania maps, sorted by difficulty](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/147552) by **Entozer** and [\[GUIDE\] How to improve in osu!mania](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/146615) by **Drace** for a decent list sorted by relative player's difficulties, and providing an experienced gameplay insight for beginners starting out in osu!mania.

Also, [a ranked beatmap version of the osu! tutorial](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/19928) is good for practicing some of the possible mapping design. It is an excellent training map for newbies and experienced players.

Lastly, there is a project by **Rivenation** for [advanced beatmap searching](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/380485 "osu!search - Advanced beatmap searching by Rivenation") named [osu!search](http://osusearch.com/ "osu!search") which not only has the same features as the official beatmap searchbar but also has some neat features to define a specific beatmap requirement.

**What does level in my profile actually do?**

**Absolutely nothing**. There is no difference in any way when comparing a Level 100 player against a Level 1 player except the player's own skills and experience of the game mode in question. There is no handicap for the lower level nor is there an advantage for the higher level (except personal experience and hardware used).

Level will be based on total score accumulated when online with account regardless of pass or fail on the beatmap. The formula is [shown here](/wiki/Score/#level).

**Why is my profile stats different ingame?**

Keep in mind that osu! has four game modes so you might be looking at the wrong game mode.

**How do I change the default keyboard key input for my game mode of choice?**

*Main page: [Options](/wiki/Options)*

![Options sidebar with quickicons](/wiki/shared/Options_quickicons.jpg)

From the *Input* icon in the *Options* sidebar as shown above, under **Keyboard** section as shown below.

![Options keyboard section](/wiki/shared/Options_keyboard.jpg)

**Game over? Where did I mess up?**

*Main page: [Replay](wiki/Replay)*

After failing a beatmap, press the `F1` key to replay the currently failed play. The replay ends when the screen darkens, with an osu! logo in the middle, rather than the game over screen. To rewatch the replay again, hold the custom default grave/tilde (`` `/~ ``) key (can be changed in Options sidebar; inside *Change keyboard bindings* as **Quick Retry (hold briefly)**) or `Ctrl`+`R` for a while.

Due to the non-standard replay screen, use the `Esc` key to return to Song Selection. Retrying the play (as in, actual play) of the beatmap in this state is not possible. It currently works in Solo mode only when given the game over screen. **This replay will not be saved nor allowed to be exported.** To record the failed replay, please use external third-party software for now since osu! has yet to have native export support for failed replay.

**Does osu! has keyboard shortcuts?**

*For a full list of shortcuts, see: [Shortcut Key Reference](/wiki/Shortcut_Key_Reference)*

Pressing the `Insert` key (the default keyboard setting) will hide, pause (if playing) and mute osu! into the *Windows* sidebar. Find the osu! logo in the *Windows* sidebar, and click on it to return osu! to the state before pressing the key. It is called the **Boss key**, and can be modified in `Change keyboard bindings` (in `Options`, under *Keyboard* section), located at the end of the *Universal* section.

Another interesting shortcut is `Alt`+`Enter`. The shortcut toggles the fullscreen mode button in `Options`, but does not work during gameplay or in Multi.

**What should I backup when fresh installing osu! on a new device?**

The whole `osu!` folder, including hidden files, is the short answer. On the new device after running `osu!install.exe` and completing osu! installation successfully, copy the backup `osu!` folder and merge to the new device's `osu!` folder. If it ask for merging `.dll` or `.exe` files, ignore it. Allow merging for everything else, including `.cfg` and `.db` files.

**Can I use osu! on my mobile device?**

*For a full list of unofficial ports, see: [External Ports](/wiki/External_Ports)*

The current osu! client does not support any mobile platform.

However, there are other unofficial ports of osu! and a single official spin-off game for iOS which uses their own leaderboard and account system.

A few of the notable ports are:

- ![osu! icon](/wiki/shared/mode/osu.png) [opsu!](http://itdelatrisu.github.io/opsu/) [Windows/OS X/Linux/Android]:
  Java port of osu! chiefly done by **itdelatrisu** with **fluddokt** providing support for Android version.
- ![osu!taiko icon](/wiki/shared/mode/taiko.png) [T-Aiko! v2](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/58640) [Android/iOS]:
  osu!taiko mode ported by **low.moe (Guy-kun) team** with new daily ranked challenge and refined T-Aiko! leaderboard.
- ![osu! icon](/wiki/shared/mode/osu.png) [osu!stream](/wiki/osu!stream) [iOS]:
  Experience the new spin-off of the osu! game mode for the iOS developed by osu! team from grounds up.

## Game modes

### ![osu! icon](/wiki/shared/mode/osu.png) osu!standard

**Why am I seeing random white lines on screen every time I play?**

Make sure that the smoke/skywriting key binding is not the same as the key binding used to tap with when playing.

![osu! smoke effect](/wiki/shared/osu_smoke.jpg "Smoke Usage")

![osu! smoke settings](/wiki/shared/osu_smoke_set.jpg "Smoke key in Key Bindings")

**Why do I not have the max possible combo when I have no misses?**

![Image showing a slider with slider ticks, with top part during Edit and bottom part during play](/wiki/shared/Sliderticks.png)

*Top image shows a slider with all the slider ticks shown in Edit mode; Bottom image shows the same slider during play, with some slider ticks obstructed by start and end circle of the slider.*

**A slider was released early (meaning that the ball was released before it had finished the ending slider point).**

A slider is composed of a starting circle point, spaced smaller circles known as slider ticks, reverse arrow points (if used, it will be treated as starting circle point instead; it is a proper slider in reverse), and an ending circle point. Each of those points on a slider will add one to the combo. Note that the starting circle point is worth 30 points, the slider ticks are worth 10 points each, the reverse arrow points are worth 30 points each, and the end circle point is worth 300 (or geki), 100 (or katu), or 50 points depending on how the slider was completed.

Slider ticks only appears inside its own slider path; if the slider ticks are too close to the start or end circle as shown in the image above, it will be hidden inside the start or end circle. Hidden slider ticks still counts into combo and score, so it must be collected along with the visible slider ticks. If the slider has one or more reverse arrow points, then the slider ticks will reappear at the same place to be collected in reverse.

If miss the timing to tap the starting circle point, miss the slider ticks, or miss the reverse arrow points, combo will break (it should trigger a combo break sound when the combo is high enough) but it is not considered a miss. However, if miss the ending circle point, combo does not break and does not increment by one. It is also not considered a miss; instead, a 100 (or katu for end of the combo) will be given for the entire slider, assuming at least the slider starting circle point done properly, and completed all the slider ticks/reverse arrow points when given. Notably, [Sudden Death](wiki/Sudden_Death) game mod will not trigger its effect of immediate game over when missing the ending circle point (since the combo did not break, the Sudden Death effect was not triggered).

These situations, caused by a slider, are collectively called **sliderbreak**. A max combo play can be known by checking the result screen for the *Perfect* notice on the performance graph; not having the *Perfect* notice, especially without any miss, usually means there is one or more sliderbreak occurred during play.

### ![osu!taiko icon](/wiki/shared/mode/taiko.png) osu!taiko

**What does "Use Taiko skin for Taiko mode" in Options under Skin section do?**

The button only works if a folder named `taiko` (capitalisation does not matter) inside the `Skins` folder of the `osu!` file directory existed.

When enabled, it will use the `taiko` folder's skin elements when playing in osu!taiko, regardless of current skin's taiko elements. If the `taiko` folder was not found, or disabled, it will use the current skin's taiko elements when available; default if all/certain taiko skin element was not found.

**Ancient trivia note:** `taiko` folder used to hold *[Taiko by LuiginHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/41319)* skin, which could be downloaded from the now-deprecated `osume.exe` (an osu! updater when osu! need to update) under Skin tab. As the button does not check whether the folder contains elements from *LuigiHann's skin*, it was quickly noted by the community and used as a personal global osu!taiko skin folder.

## Beatmapping

**This beatmap you're trying to submit isn't owned by you!**

*Note: For unranked beatmaps only.*

![Example of an .osu file content](/wiki/shared/Beatmap_not_owned.png)

Please follow these steps:-

1. Leave the editor (or close osu!) to make sure the changes apply properly
2. Check the name of the beatmap's folder
    - If it starts with numbers, remove them. Otherwise, osu! will treat it as BeatmapSetID
3. Make sure that the `.mp3` does not start with numbers. Edit the filename in the `.osu` files if it does.
4. Open all the `.osu` files with a text editor (*Notepad* will work)
    - Set your name as creator (and replace it in the file name as well)
    - Set the BeatmapID to 0
    - Set the BeatmapSetID to -1
