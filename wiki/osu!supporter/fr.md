To get osu!supporter, sign in (or [sign up](/wiki/sign_up)), then go to the [store page](/store/products/supporter-tag). Use the slider or the month buttons (underneath the slider) to select the duration of the osu!supporter tag. A different duration will change the price you will pay. The currency used is in United States dollars (USD). If your country uses a different currency, please use a currency converter such as [OANDA](https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/) or [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=usd+exchange+rate) to check the price. The prices displayed on the osu!store page are by per individual account.

### Selecting the duration

![Buying osu!supporter](img/selecting-duration.jpg "Selecting the user and duration for osu!supporter")

The usercard displayed above the slider is the user you are buying osu!supporter for. By default, it should be your usercard. To gift to a friend, enter your friend's username (not user ID) into the grey box below the usercard. Once this is done, the usercard will change to match the username you had entered. From here, you can then select the duration of osu!supporter you want to gift, but keep in mind that there is no promotion for group gifting.

You can only buy or gift osu!supporter to one user at a time within this screen. To gift another user, you will need to go back to the [osu!supporter store page](/store/products/supporter-tag) and repeat the steps for adding another user.

### Checking out

Once you are done, click `Add to Cart` to put it into the osu!store shopping cart.
