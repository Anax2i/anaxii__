Decide
------

By default, your account will be shown. If you do not want the osu!supporter, click on "Gift another player" and write the name of the account. If you want to gift to more than an account, click "Add another tag" button beside the "Checkout" button. After confirming the accounts, drag the white button below an account to determine how long for the account and how much you will have to pay in total. You can set different duration for different accounts along with different cost. After confirming the duration and the accounts, click "Checkout".

Payment
-------

After confirming the duration and the accounts, click "Checkout". Here, you will be given various options. It is recommended to use [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com) or Credit Card services. There are other ways to pay (such as SMS or local service providers such as [Cherry Credits](http://www.cherrycredits.com/)) but additional fees will be charged for their effort. If you pay less than your "Total Cost" in "dorrah" (including additional cost if using non-Paypal), you will not receive your tag(s).
