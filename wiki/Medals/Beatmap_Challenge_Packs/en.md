# Beatmap Challenge Packs

**Beatmap Challenge Packs medals**, or alternatively referred to as [*Skill Packs medals*](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-11-20-featured-artist-beatmap-updates-from-the-mappers-guild#pack-medal-updates), are medals awarded upon clearing the hardest difficulty present on all beatmaps featured in certain [Theme Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=theme) or [Artist/Album Beatmap Packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs?type=artist) *without any [difficulty reduction mods](/wiki/Game_modifier#difficulty-reduction) enabled*. These beatmap packs are specifically curated to test each player's comprehension of various gameplay aspects around a specific skill level, e.g. within a particular [star rating](/wiki/Beatmap/Difficulty#star-rating) or difficulty cap range.

All beatmaps in the pack have to be cleared in the [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) game mode in order to qualify for the badge unless otherwise specified.
