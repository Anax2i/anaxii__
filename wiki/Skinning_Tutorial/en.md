# Skinning Tutorial

*See also: [Skinning](/wiki/Skinning).*

*This article is the tutorial for skinning. For frequently answered skinning questions, see [Skinning/FAQ](/wiki/Skinning/FAQ).*

## Getting Started

To dip your toes into skinning, open the osu! client, select Options, and click `Open osu! folder`. Once the file explorer opens, click on `Skins` and create a new folder. You can name it whatever you want, but keep in mind that osu! will use this name when it is displayed in the Options. Inside this folder, you can add any skinning elements listed in the skin element lists.

Contrary to popular belief, to get a better understanding of how skinning works, you should start by mixing skins (copying other skin files and paste them into your newly created skin folder). **It should be noted that you are not allowed to share these in the forums,** but mixing skins for yourself can help you learn what skinning can and can not achieve in osu!

Whether or not if you do start by mixing skins, see the next section below to get started on making a skin.

## Making a skin

To get started on making a skin, you will first need an image and, optionally, an audio editor. There are many options to choose that vary in functionality and cost. Despite this, any software you use will probably work, as long as you know how to use it.

-   Image editors
    -   [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) (Free)
    -   [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net) (Free)
    -   [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) (Paid)
-   Audio editors
    - [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) (Free)
    - [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/) (Free/Paid)

The next thing you will need is a theme or an idea. You should have one in mind to create an objective for what you want your skin to look like. This is also to help yourself when you need to gather and/or create assets.

The last thing to have ready is patience and a lot of time. Yes, this is very important as new skins (unfortunately) don't complete in a snap. Making a new skin can take a week and up to months or more, so give it some time.
