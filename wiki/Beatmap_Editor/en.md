The **beatmap editor** is osu!'s in-game graphical interface for creating [beatmaps](beatmap "wikilink"). It is separated into four modes:

-   [Compose](Compose "wikilink"): This is where [Hit Objects](Hit_Object "wikilink") are placed and edited. Most of the time spent in the editor is done here.
-   [Design](Design "wikilink"): This is where the Storyboard is made, most mappers will only use the "Background Image/Video" button here.
-   [Timing](Timing "wikilink"): This is where the song's BPM and offset are entered. This window also control hitsounds if they aren't constant throughout the map.
-   [Song Setup](Song_Setup "wikilink"): This is where various options regarding the map are set. This includes combo colors and difficulty settings.
