The Beat Snap Divisor is used to limit where notes can be placed so that they always fall on the beat. Moving the slider to the right increases the granularity of the notes, that is, more notes can be placed in the same measure.

Each of the settings put different colors of ticks on the [Timelines](Timelines "wikilink"). The ticks are as follows (for [Standard](Standard "wikilink"), [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink"), and [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink")):

| A Measure                        | Divisor | Beat              | Ticks notes                                        | Notes                          |
|----------------------------------|---------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![](BSD 1 1b.jpg "BSD 1 1b.jpg") | 1/1     | Full Beats        | White ticks only                                   | Best used for Easy difficulty. |
| ![](BSD 1 2.jpg "BSD 1 2.jpg")   | 1/2     | Half Beats        | Adds red ticks                                     |                                |
| ![](BSD 1 3.jpg "BSD 1 3.jpg")   | 1/3     | Triplets\*        | Has two purple ticks between each white tick       | Compound timing                |
| ![](BSD 1 4.jpg "BSD 1 4.jpg")   | 1/4     | Quarter Beats     | Adds blue ticks, in addition to the red ticks      | Useful for general mapping.    |
| ![](BSD 1 6.jpg "BSD 1 6.jpg")   | 1/6     | Double Triplets\* | Has two purple ticks between each red tick         | Compound timing                |
| ![](BSD 1 8.jpg "BSD 1 8.jpg")   | 1/8     | Eighth Beats      | Adds yellow ticks, in addition to the red and blue |                                |

The 1/3 and 1/6 are special because it means your BPM is divisible by three, but this is *rare*.

Holding down the **\[ALT\]** button over the slider changes it to the [distance spacing](Distance_Snap "wikilink") slider
