## Ruleset

1. **The [osu! Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/osu!) and [General Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) are in effect for this contest.** The winning prize of the contest includes ranking the 3 beatmaps submitted by the winning teams, which we cannot get it done if the beatmaps do not abide by the Ranking Criteria. Any required difficulties to fulfill the requirements of the Ranking Criteria will be supplied by the [Organisation Team](#organisation). Inapplicable cases such as spread requirements are excluded from this rule.
2. **3-6 members per team required.** The main concept of the contest is to exhibit the potential of each country, meaning that a collaboration of at least 2 members on each song will be required from the team members. How you organize the sections is completely up to you.
3. **Each mapper must contribute at least once during the contest.** Since this is a country-based competition that requires teamwork, we would like to have each member of a team rewarded fairly for their diligence. Failing to help other teammates and letting them pull the strings is considered unsportsmanlike and may get you disqualified from the contest.
4. **A team must participate in at least 3 rounds in order to be eligible for prizes.** We don't want our competitors to burn out, but we still want to reward the ones who deserve it.
5. **Stealing or plagiarizing others' work is strictly prohibited.** Copying other users' intellectual properties is highly unethical and forbidden by the [Beatmap Submission Rules](/wiki/Rules#beatmap-submission-rules). If your submission is found to be plagiarized, your team will be disqualified from the contest immediately. 
6. **Uploading your submission through [BSS](/wiki/Submission) or sharing it on any third-party websites before the deadline is strictly prohibited.** This includes asking for external help, sharing the beatmap with users outside of your team. Violation of this rule will result in disqualification. We strongly recommend not revealing any related materials as well, such as photos and screenshots of your submission.
7. **Entries can only be submitted through the official website.** This process is made to ease the management of the difficulties between the judges and the contestants. No entries will be accepted through any means other than the website. For any questions regarding using the website, please contact the hosts of the contest.
8. **Submissions will not be accepted after the deadline.** As everybody will share the same time period to map for each round, extending the deadline for any particular team would be unfair for others. Therefore, any entries submitted after the deadline will not be taken into account. The website will automatically close submissions once the deadline has passed.
9. **Custom hitsounds are allowed, but none will be provided.** You are allowed, and even encouraged, to use custom hitsounds. How you will organize them will be up to you.
10. **Changing the contents of the provided `.osz` file is prohibited.** This includes changing the timing of the `.osu` file, replacing or removing the `.mp3` file, altering the metadata of tags, titles and artists as well. We would like to avoid any complications during the judging process, thus submissions containing altered versions of mentioned values or contents will be considered invalid. 
11. **Do not include storyboards or beatmap backgrounds.** They will not be considered in the judging process and will be removed prior to entries being passed onto the judges.
12. **Restricted users cannot take part in the contest.** For the legitimacy of this contest, restricted users are not allowed to participate. If a restricted user is identified to contribute to this contest in a team, the entire team will be disqualified.
13. **Teams must consist of users from a single country only.** Merging or combining countries does not allow people to represent their individual country to the fullest. You can only join the team that belongs to the country displayed on your osu! profile.
14. **Keep the organizers in touch with team updates past the preparation phase.** If a contestant has to drop out from the contest for any reason, please let the staff know about it as soon as possible. No replacements will be allowed and no rewards will be attributed to the user if the team achieves the top 3 or is nominated for the Players' Pick award. Users that quit the contest are not able to rejoin. If the number of participants drops below the required minimum, the team will be disqualified.

## FAQ

1. **What is this contest?**

The osu! Beatmapping World Championship is a standard mode contest where several countries compete against each other to show off their country's mapping ability. Each team member will be handpicked by a Team Captain, composed of 3 to 6 members, including the Team Captain.

2. **How does this contest work?**

During the Registration period, participants are expected to team up with users under the same country and decide on a team name. After the Registrations, all teams are supposed to enter the First Round. Users can form multiple teams under the same country; however, only the team with the highest score among them may proceed to the Second Round. From the Second Round onwards, there will be three more rounds. The results of these three rounds will remain confidential until the conclusion of the Fourth Round. Once the Fourth Round ends, combined results will be announced during the livestream. This is to encourage teams that passed the First Round to stay in this contest till the end and not get unexpectedly impacted by intermediate results.

3. **What will be the songs?**

The songs will be announced as soon as the stage starts. Keep in mind that all the songs used for this contest will be picked from the [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) library.

4. **What is a "Team Captain"?**

The Team Captains, also called Captains will be the ones in charge of communicating with the organizers and their team members in order to let us know about team-related things. No additional requirements are needed to become a Team Captain.

5. **What if my country doesn't have a Team Captain?**

Youâ€™re free to apply as one through the website if you wish to participate! The country you will be allowed to participate with will be based on your profile's flag. No country merge will be allowed to avoid management complications.

6. **Do I have to join the Discord server to participate?**

Only the Team Captain is required to join the Discord server. The team members however are very welcomed to join, as all the important information will be shared on Discord and on our website.

7. **Can I join the Discord server even if I don't want to participate in the contest?**

Yes, you can. Upon joining, you'll be placed in the `#arrival` channel, where you will have to post your osu! profile link, and then a member of the staff or a moderator will accept you.

8. **"At least 2 mappers will have to collaborate on each song" - Are we able to work with my full team on each map?**

Yes! We set this rule to make sure the main spirit of the contest about collaborations remains, while not restricting people with their team management. If you want to work on a full team on each stage, youâ€™re encouraged to do so!

9. **Can I make an osu!mania, osu!taiko or osu!catch beatmap?**

Unfortunately, this edition of the contest is for the osu! game mode only. However, we are planning to organize multi-mode editions in 2 months upon the start of this edition! 

10. **Will this event be broadcasted on Twitch?**

Yes, many of the contest-related events will be broadcasted on our Twitch channel. During the livestreams, there will be a summary of all important moments of the contest.

11. **My team has been eliminated in the very first round of the contest, do I have a chance to win the Players' Pick award?**

Your entry will be taken into consideration by the Players' Pick judges even if your team was eliminated in the regular contest. Consider the Players' Pick as a sort of side category that has its own leaderboard.
