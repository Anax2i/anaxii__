Note: Depending on the song, it is possible to use these techniques (through, [\#Ninja Spinners](#Ninja_Spinners "wikilink") are absolutely forbidden). These techniques are placed here due to it being very difficult to use while getting the [map](map "wikilink") [ranked](ranked "wikilink").

Ninja Spinners
--------------

A ninja spinner is an extremely short [spinner](Spinner "wikilink") (typically only two [beats](Timing "wikilink") or less) that is inserted at a point in the map where you have almost no time to prepare for it. In addition to that, it typically goes to absolutely nothing in the music and is mainly done for the heck of it. They are typically seen in older maps before pretty much everybody got tired of ninja spinners and decided to ban them.

A typical [beatmap](beatmap "wikilink") famous for ninja spinners is [Wizards in Winter](http://osu.ppy.sh/s/132). Most players on the list get about 20 "50" in their record due to ninja spinners.

### Why It's Unrankable

Ninja spinners are [unrankable](Ranking_Criteria "wikilink") because they typically break a player's [combo](Combo "wikilink") for no real reason whatsoever. Responding to ninja spinners is not seen by the modding community as an act of skill but as an act of memorizing where the spinners appear. Most players do not find true ninja spinners enjoyable as a result, and hence they are banned. If you want to put a short spinner in your map, simply give the player time to prepare for the spinner (at least half a beat should do) and give them ample time to recover after the spinner (for short spinners, at least a beat is recommended).

One suggested reason is that "SS can be theoretically achieved for every beatmaps". In ninja spinners, it's impossible to get 300. In even faster ones, player don't need to spin but a 50 is automatically given (like the above example, *Wizards in Winter*).
