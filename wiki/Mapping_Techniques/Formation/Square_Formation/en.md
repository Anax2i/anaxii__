# Square Formation

![](./img/basic.png)

Nominator: Beuchi-chan

Basically, this is 4 hitcircles forming a square shape.
These usually have some space between each other.
The square can be angled to form a diamond.
The order of the combos forces the player to go along the square rather than through it.
