Use same technique for any slider with straight bits and curved bits

![](MGS_05.png "MGS_05.png")

When you want a slider with a transition between a curved bit and a straight bit you use a red point where it switches. The most important thing is to ALWAYS PUT THE RED POINT AND POINTS ON EITHER SIDE IN A STRAIGHT LINE. Like exactly straight. Get a ruler if you have to. We don't want any sharp bends here kthx. But yeah it's pretty straightforward apart from that.
