There are a couple of ways to do this, depending on what kind of wiggle you're after.

Type 1
------

Start and end pointing the same way.

The important thing here is that each arc that make up the wiggle is made up of four points, and as you get closer to the centre the taller the four points need to be. Once you have the basic shape, it's just messing around and eyeballing until it looks even and the tail end of the slider lines up on the last point. As with arcs, don't forget to be Ctrl + Hing all the time to make sure the points are symmetrical. Other than that, it's mostly practice. Once you've made a few nice looking wiggles you'll be able to knock them out in no time.

Type 2
------

Start and end pointing different ways.

Similarly to type 1, each arc is made up of four points, but in my experience it helps if they're kinda twisted round, like in the image. These are rotationally symmetrical, like waves, so use Ctrl + H + J to check points.

Type 3
------

Super Tight Wiggles

Sometimes wiggles are just too tight to use the above method, so red-points are necessary. Make sure that the points of each section between each pair of red-points are identical, apart from the end ones - you can check this by duplicating the slider and moving them around, checking it lines up all the way along, or by simply counting grids. Also, make sure that each redpoint and the two points either side make a perfect straight line, to avoid unwanted bumps. The sections towards the end really need to be eyeballed, and should be what you adjust when you want to make the tail end land on the last point. This just takes a lot of messing around, but hopefully you'll get there eventually.
