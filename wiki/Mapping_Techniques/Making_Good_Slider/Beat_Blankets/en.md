Blankets are easiest to do if you eyeball the slider first of all to get it roughly correct, then scroll to a point on the timeline where the approach circle of the beat lines up with the closest edge of the slider's startpoint. It may help to go into 1/8 snap to get it just right. Then just tweak the points until the whole slider lines up with the approach circle as perfectly as you can.

Keep in mind that if you want a slider to blanket **and** be perfectly symmetrical, worry about symmetry first *then* adjust the points symmetrically to improve the blanket.

As a variation of Beat Blankets, sometimes I use a spinner to make nice circles. ![](MGS_19.png "fig:MGS_19.png")
