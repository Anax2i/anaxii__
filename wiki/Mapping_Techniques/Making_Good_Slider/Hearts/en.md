Use same technique for any slider which is symmetrical, but the startpoint is on the centre line

How to do this
--------------

First, make a basic heart shape, slightly longer than you need, with both the start and end points in the same place at the bottom. Try and copy these points roughly if you're having trouble. Putting just a redpoint at the top is fine, but I prefer to use an elbow curve :P ![](MGS_07.png "fig:MGS_07.png")

Next, copy and paste this slider to the tick immediately after itself and horizontal flip like so ![](MGS_08.png "fig:MGS_08.png")

Then grab the endpoint of the first slider and pull it back to the length you want your slider to be. ![](MGS_09.png "fig:MGS_09.png")

See how it's asymmetrical and ugly? well mess with the points on the tail half of the slider until it lines up perfectly with the slider behind. ![](MGS_10.png "fig:MGS_10.png")

If you managed all that, you're done! Delete the slider behind and edit/scale by if you want to fill any gaps. ![](MGS_11.png "fig:MGS_11.png")
