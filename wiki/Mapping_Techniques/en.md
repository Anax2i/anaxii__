## FAQ

### What are Mapping Techniques?

Mapping Techniques are methods and/or object placement patterns that are widely used by known mappers in their maps.

Note: It is best to treat these pages as a beginner's guide until you have developed your own mapping style.
At first, it is recommended to observe and copy other experienced mappers' styles, while letting your creativity free little by little.
Many great mappers sharpened their skills at first by imitating others they admired, so there is no shame in doing that yourself.
