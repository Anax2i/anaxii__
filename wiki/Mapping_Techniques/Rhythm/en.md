Streams
-------

<img src="Streams.jpg" title="fig:An example of long 1/4 streams." alt="An example of long 1/4 streams." width="300" /> A stream is a succession of [hit objects](Hit_Object "wikilink") (usually [hitcircles](hitcircles "wikilink")) at a quick, consistent pace from each other. When somebody refers to a "stream", they are usually referring to a stream of hit circles a fourth of a [beat](Timing "wikilink") from each other. If a player wants to refer to a stream of hit objects half a beat apart from each other, they typically call it a "1/2 stream".

Streams became popular due to music from beatmania IIDX, Eurobeat, (or fast paced/BPM music) and remixes which contain dense drum patterns so that a stream fits well with the music.

**When to Use**

Streams are best used at higher difficulties when the stream corresponds to sounds in the music. In most songs this only occurs at certain parts in the music, but certain genres like Eurobeat have plenty of places where one can put streams. Some streams contain [hit circles](Hit_Object "wikilink") only but some are mixed with [slider](slider "wikilink"). Take the following song for example: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn7uMwXYU9U) You'll notice that the vocals never have any parts where it'd be fitting for a stream. However, listen closely to the instruments. You should notice that the instruments frequently have 3 notes all 1/4 apart from each other. You could map a stream to each one of those instances, making for a map with frequent, short streams.

**When NOT to Use**

</div>
In [Standard](Standard "wikilink"), it's recommended to only put streams where it corresponds to instruments in the music. Doing otherwise is often called "[overmapping](overmapping "wikilink")". Now, one can most certainly put streams where it doesn't go to anything, but it's not recommended, especially when you're a new mapper.

On the other hand, [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink") maps will creates a new pattern fitting the music (this is exceptional because the drums usually holds the beat). So generally more streams are found in [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink") maps. However, abusing the streams (or "[overmapping](overmapping "wikilink")") is **never** recommended.
