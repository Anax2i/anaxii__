Spacing Out refers to hit objects in which they are placed distance-wise, not time.
This technique has the advantage of keeping a momentum in a tune running during that section of a map.
However, incorrect patternmapping can lead to an almost unplayable map.

Basically, form a square around the center with 4 hit circles.
The next 4 hit circles are then to be placed 1 grid space outwards and so on.

Another varient you can add is to place a hit circle in the center after each cycle.
