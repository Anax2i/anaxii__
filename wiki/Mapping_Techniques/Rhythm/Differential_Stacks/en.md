# Differential Stacks

Differential Stacks consist of notes that are spaced apart inconsistently from each other in the timeline. 
A notable thing is that these objects are mapped as if they are a consistent beat.

Some sightreading may be required unless you can really follow the music.

When playing a beatmap using this technique, it can be very challenging to play with the hidden game modifier.
