# Drain Sections

Drain sections is a section in a beatmap that suddenly becomes _slower_ or _less difficult_ in an attempt to either match the song better or cause the HP bar to drain.

This can be done by placing less notes and/or slowing the slider speed.

Drain sections should be used sparingly and only when the song may _hint_ it.
