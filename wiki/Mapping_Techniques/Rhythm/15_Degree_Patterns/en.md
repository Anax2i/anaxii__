15 Degree Patterns is a slider exclusive technique.
You start off by mapping a section with only horizontal and vertical sliders.
You then rotate them 15 degrees clockwise or counterclosewise.

This adds a more style to a group of sliders.

## Tutorial

1. Find a section in your beatmap that only contains horizontal (left and right) and vertical (up and down) sliders only.
2. Select those sliders by either `Ctrl` + clicking on them or by dragging along the timeline.
3. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `R`
4. Enter `15` in the text box.
   - You can choose either clockwise or counterclosewise, it doesn't really matter.
5. Voil√†, your done!
