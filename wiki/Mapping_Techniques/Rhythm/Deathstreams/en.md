Deathstreams are _very_ long and difficult streams.
These consist of sliders (with or without repeats), hit circles or a combination of both.

The job of a deathstream is to practically fail players that cannot handle ordinary streams.

The use of deathstreams will make your map **unrankable**!
However, it may go through as one of the _approved_ beatmaps.
