Introduction
============

Drum to the beat of your favourite songs and become a part of T-Aiko!

T-Aiko! is a rhythm game inspired by Taiko no Tatsujin (Taiko Drum Master) with the huge library of songs from osu! which is compatible with T-Aiko!

Installation
------------

<u>**Motorola phones are not supported.**</u>

[`Original` `Post`](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/58640)`Â `

-   Use your phone (must be Android) and go online (by Wi-Fi or Packet Data).
-   Go to [Google Play page for T-Aiko!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=guy.taiko&feature=search_result)
-   Allow the file to install.
-   T-Aiko! is now installed in your phone.

Adding Beatmaps
---------------

**<u>Device way</u>** [Alternative guide](http://osudroid.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=30)

-   Get connected to the internet.
-   Open T-Aiko! and press "Get Maps"
    -   If the "Get Maps" is grayed out, it means you are not connected to the internet. A small guide on how to get beatmaps can also be found here.
-   Pick your song of choice to download. (The file will go to the songs directory that is set by you or by default)
-   Wait for it. You can continue searching or leave after the downloading is completed.
-   Press "Play" from your main menu and the beatmap can be played.

**<u>USB way</u>**

-   Connect your device to PC with USB cable.
    -   You may need to configure your device to USB mode to connect the PC. Please do so before plugging in and/or making any report.
-   Put the songs files (either in .osz or folder form) into **<u>T-Aiko!/Songs</u>** directory.
    -   Directory will vary **if you did modify it in Advanced Option. You need to put in that directory you set instead.**
-   Plug off your device and launch T-Aiko!
-   Go to Song selection and press the refresh button at the upper-left of the screen.
-   Your new beatmaps is now playable.

What is the difference?
-----------------------

-   Some beatmaps may not work on T-Aiko!. (?)
-   Spinners may appear as a single large red note. (?)
-   Character (like Don and Katsu) will not appear \[due to copyright issues\].
-   The game itself cannot be skinned currently.
-   Song length appears as blue line above the large drum and below the conveyer white line while lifebar is simplifies to a red line at upper left of the screen.
-   A large drum at the second half of the screen (Can be disabled). Hitting the drum creates red note (Don) and hitting outside the drum area creates blue note (Katsu).
-   Video and Storyboard is unsupported.
-   Combo Fire and Combo Burst (Character appearance) will not appear.
-   [Game Modifiers](Game_Modifiers "wikilink"): Only [Auto](Auto "wikilink").
-   Information (Length, BPM) about the beatmap selected is missing.
-   Beatmap search is missing.
-   Ranking and Replays are not available.
-   Placement of taiko-specific background is somewhat off placement (due to screen size and cropping it is not a good idea).

Questions
=========

I added a new beatmap and T-Aiko! didn't load it
------------------------------------------------

-   You did not hit the refresh button at the upper-left of the "Select a Song".
-   You placed the beatmap at the wrong beatmap directory or you set a wrong beatmap directory. Set the beatmap directory properly \[See below\] and replace your beatmap to a proper beatmap directory.

I have a lot of beatmaps at osu!droid/Songs...
----------------------------------------------

-   From Main Menu, press Options-&gt; Advanced Options-&gt; Beatmap Folder.
-   Modify "mnt/sdcard/T-Aiko!/Songs" to "mnt/sdcard/osu!droid/Songs".
-   Return to Main Menu.
    -   T-Aiko! may stop abruptly to follow the new filepath and the application may shut down itself.
-   Press T-Aiko application and go to Play menu (Song selection). Your beatmaps should appear.
    -   If your new beatmaps did not appear, press the refresh button located at the upper-left screen. It will recompile the beatmaps library.

Can I log in using my osu! account?
-----------------------------------

No.

-   If you wish to log-in (requires internet connection), you have to log-in your osu!droid/T-Aiko! account or sign up if you haven't in either one of it.
-   If you choose not to log-in, you will be treated as "Guest".
