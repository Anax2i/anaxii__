FAQ and troubleshooting
=======================

osu!
----

-   **I try to run osu! and get an 'Initialization Error**'
    -   Make sure you have the [.NET Framework 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22) installed.
-   **Why can't I download from the Beatmap listing?**
    -   You need to register for the site first. Registration is free and very quick, and as well as giving you the benefit of accessing beatmap downloads, it also allows you to obtain a ranking on the online leaderboards and chat to other players in-game. So there's no excuse not to sign up!
-   **I can't play the Beatmap I downloaded!**
    -   Your file is incomplete/corrupted. Did you just canceled the download half-way? If so, search back that song name and download it again and stay till the song is completed it's download properly.
        -   osu! will put the incomplete/corrupted song under "Failed" folder in "Songs" folder file.
-   **Something else going wrong?**
    -   If you come across a bug or error not listed above, check out the [Bug Reports forum](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/5) and post there (searching through existing threads first is highly recommended). Someone will definitely be around to help. Just make sure you speak your points clearly and provide a proof to back-up your points (like a screenshot, video, and/or the steps to reproduce).
    -   Also, please consider using the osu! IRC channel if you are bit skeptical to post at Bug Reports section.

osu!droid
---------

-   What versions of Android OS are supported?
    -   All versions since 1.6 (Donut).
-   Will you support storyboard/video?
    -   No.
-   Will you make a <feature name>?
    -   Make your request in the [feature requests thread](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/62313).

T-Aiko
------

-   I can't play on my Android phone!
    -   Do you happen to be using a Motorola smartphone? There seems to be a bug in Motorola Android firmware that causes the game to crash when pressing play without even letting you send an error report. The only recommendation to-do is to install a (Stock) Google ROM.
    -   If you discover any (bugs/problems), please post at [this forum post](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/58640) complete with what smartphone you are using and the steps to reproduce the problem.
