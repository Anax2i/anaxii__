### Rank

*For Ranked beatmaps see [Ranked beatmap](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink").*

1.  Another word for a [grade](#Grade "wikilink").
2.  A player’s standing in the online leaderboard (a.k.a Player [Rankings](#Ranking "wikilink")).
3.  Verb, "to rank", i.e. to second another moderator’s nomination and include a submitted [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to the Ranked Beatmap list, making scores achieved by anyone playing it count towards each player’s Ranking. Getting their beatmaps ranked is a goal of every beatmapper.

### Ranking

Alternatively called Leaderboard. A list which sorts members of the [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community according to certain criteria. Can also refer to one's position in such a list. osu! currently has three Rankings: i) Player Rankings: the Ranking most commonly referred to, this list sorts players depending on their Ranked Score. Ranked Score is the sum of the highest score a player has achieved in every [ranked](ranked "wikilink") [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") he has played. Only [scores](Score "wikilink") achieved after the beatmap is ranked are taken into account. Only one score from each beatmap (the highest) is taken into account, regardless of how many difficulty versions it has. ii) Beatmapper Rankings: This list sorts everyone who has created at least one ranked beatmap, depending on the weighted average of all the ratings given to their beatmaps by other players, multiplied by a bonus modifier that increases the more ranked beatmaps they have. iii) Moderator Rankings: This list sorts moderators depending on how many posts they have made in the Beatmap sub-forums, i.e. how much beatmap [modding](modding "wikilink") they are doing.

### Recalc

Recalculate [Slider](Slider "wikilink") Lengths. A command under the Timing header of the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") screen. Select it when a change in [BPM](BPM "wikilink") is made after Sliders have been placed. This command will try to automatically adjust the length of every Slider in the [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to the new BPM. After choosing this command, especially if a large change in BPM has been made, it is important to check every Slider and adjust its length manually where necessary.

### Resnap

A pair of commands under the [Timing](#Timing "wikilink") header of the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") screen, one of which applies to the entire [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") and the other to the current [timing section](#Timing_section "wikilink") (if the beatmap has only one timing section, both commands are the same). Select when there has been a change in [offset](#Offset "wikilink") and/or [BPM](BPM "wikilink") after [objects](objects "wikilink") have been placed. This command will try to automatically reposition all objects on the timeline so that they fall on the closest [beat](#Beat "wikilink") division your [Snap Divisor](Beat_Snap_Divisor "wikilink") allows. After choosing this command, especially if a large change in BPM and/or offset has been made, it is important to check every object and adjust its position on the timeline manually where necessary.

### Reverse Arrow

### RSI

**RSI**, short for **R**epetitive **S**train **I**njury, is a disorder that affects the musculoskeletal and nervous system of the body. It can be caused by repetitive tasks in awkward positions which may include playing [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") for an extended amount of time.

### Sample Set

A collection of sound effects that are heard during gameplay. People can use custom sample sets for their [beatmaps](#Beatmap "wikilink"). Apart from the default sound made when [tapping](#Tap "wikilink") a [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), the most well known elements in a sample set are the [Whistle](#Whistle "wikilink") and the [Finish](#Finish "wikilink"). Other parts of a sample set include the Slider Tick sounds and the sound made when filling the [Spinner Metre](#Spinner_Metre "wikilink").

### Silence

### Skin

A set of graphics and custom [sample sets](#Sample_Set "wikilink") that can be chosen to replace the default ones used by [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") in order to customise one's playing experience. Most of what you see and hear in osu! can be skinned. There is [a sub-forum dedicated to skins](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=15).

### Slider Tick

### Sliderbreak

The loss of [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink") from not holding a slider long enough, going out of the slider circle or not hitting the beginning of the slider (but within the follow circle of the slider). This will give a score of 100 or 50 for the note, depending on how much slider ticks are missed. Unlike [\#Missing](#Miss "wikilink"), you can still achieve an "S" rank after sliderbreaking.

### Spectate

"Spec" for short. To watch another playing a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") in real time (approx. 500 ms delay). To spectate, open [Extended Chat](#Extended_Chat "wikilink") mode and click on a grey user panel. You need to have a copy of the exact same beatmap the person you wish to spectate is playing.

### Spectator Aura

A mysterious phenomenon that could cause players to [\#Choke](#Choke "wikilink") their [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink"), or [\#Fail](#Fail "wikilink") a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") from having a spectator(s) spectate their gameplay.

### Spinner

One of three [objects](objects "wikilink") the player interacts with (the other two being the [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") and the [Slider](Slider "wikilink")) and probably the one seen least often. A Spinner is a circle that takes up the entire height of the play area and has a [\#Spinner Metre](#Spinner_Metre "wikilink") on either side. A large circular outline similar to a [Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink") appears on the Spinner’s border and gradually converges on its centre. The player should hold the mouse button down and spin in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. As long as the mouse button is held down, the cursor is locked on the Spinner’s area, so the player need not worry about going outside it. The Spinner is cleared if all the levels of the Spinner Metre are filled before its Approach Circle reaches the centre. Depending on the difficulty settings of each [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), a different number of spins are required to fill each level of the Spinner Metre (worth 100 points). If the player fills the Spinner Metre before the Approach Circle reaches the Spinner’s centre, each additional spin before time runs out will award the player with 1000 bonus points (each receiving a bonus multiplier depending on the player’s current [Combo](Combo "wikilink")). Spinning a Spinner provides a continuous minor boost to the [Life Bar](#Life_Bar "wikilink") depending on the spinning speed.

### Spinner Metre

A version 1 skinning elements that was depicted as a pair of bars on either side of a [\#Spinner](#Spinner "wikilink"). As the player spun the spinner, it would gradually fill up with colour. In order to clear the spinner, all levels of the Spinner Metre should light up before the [Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink") reaches the Spinner's centre. Each level that lights up on the Spinner Metre awards the player with 100 points (regardless of [\#Combo](#Combo "wikilink")).

### Spinner Spam

To overuse [Spinners](#Spinner "wikilink") in a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"). There are many kinds of Spinner Spam: Using very long Spinners (lasting more than 10 seconds or so), using a lot of very short Spinners (lasting less than 2 seconds or so) one after the other, or even worse, using a lot of regular sized or long Spinners one after the other. With the possible exception of some especially challenging beatmaps, Spinner Spam is to be avoided for the following reasons: i) A Spinner is by far the gameplay element that causes the player the most fatigue, since it requires rapid, repetitive, vigorous motion. A lot of Spinners or even a single long one can easily tire a player’s arm. ii) Due to the circular, often frantic motion required to clear it, after clearing a spinner the player’s cursor is often left at a random position in the screen, possibly far from an incoming [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink") or [Slider](Slider "wikilink"). A multitude of Spinners will thus be particularly disorienting for most players.

### Spread

**Spreads** is an advanced [mapping technique](Mapping_Techniques "wikilink") where the mapper places two [hit objects](hit_objects "wikilink") and irregularly located like jump style but doesn't make sense when they're click. This is usually done by either temporarily changing the distance snap multiplier or temporarily turning off distance snap. **Spreads** are techniques commonly used in an irregular rhythm [beatmap](beatmap "wikilink"). **Spreads** are typically used in [Hard](Hard "wikilink") and [Insane](Insane "wikilink") [difficulties](Song_Setup#Difficulty "wikilink").

### Spun Out (SO)

### Stacked

[Objects](Objects "wikilink") that overlap each other in the play field. Most common in [\#Hit Circles](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"), less common with Hit Circles and the edges of [sliders](Slider "wikilink") to be avoided with any other combination of objects. Stacking Hit Circles, while a clear violation of [\#Beat Spacing](#Beat_Spacing "wikilink"), is nevertheless permitted if the Hit Circles are very close to each other in the timeline (half a [\#Beat](#Beat "wikilink") or usually even less).

### Standard Submission

A way to submit a [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") through the [BSS](#BSS "wikilink") system, making it available to the [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community. Standard Submission is the one used when first uploading a beatmap, as well as when updating with changes such as [object](object "wikilink") placement, tweaks in [timing](#Timing "wikilink"), custom colour schemes, new difficulty versions etc. Every Standard Submission of a beatmap after the first is faster because only the changes are uploaded.

### Star

**Star** has two meanings:

1.  A stage in a beatmap’s [modding](modding "wikilink") process where a moderator judges a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to be on the right track but needing some improvements before he approves of it with a [bubble](bubble "wikilink"). Examples include adjustments in [timing](#Timing "wikilink"), incorrect [\#Beat Spacing](#Beat_Spacing "wikilink") in some areas, or creating additional difficulty versions. Beatmaps receiving a star are denoted by a star graphic next to their thread’s title. A star may be removed by another mod if he judges the beatmap to need a rather larger amount of improvements than expected.
2.  Can be used as a shortened form of [difficulty](difficulty "wikilink") stars.

### Star Priority

**Star Priority** is a method of helping [BNs](BN "wikilink") find beatmaps worthy of [bubbling](Beatmap_approval#Bubble "wikilink") and later [ranking](Beatmap_approval#Ranked "wikilink"). The Star Priority of a beatmap is determined by how many [mod posts](Modding "wikilink") that have gained kudosu in the beatmap's thread, the sum of kudosu stars the map set has received. A kudosu star can be given by any user to any map, though shooting a kudosu star comes at the price of one [kudosu](kudosu "wikilink"). The conversion rate was formerly three kudosu for one kudosu star that increased the Star Priority by two.

The higher the star priority, the higher the beatmap's thread appears in the Works in Progress or Pending subforum. At least 12 star priority is needed for a map to be bubbled or ranked.

### Storyboard

A set of still images, animated images and sound effects that tells a story during a [beatmap's](#Beatmap "wikilink") course but especially before the beatmap's beginning, during [breaks](#Break "wikilink") and after the beatmap's end. In the [DS games](#DS_games "wikilink"), Storyboards concern one or more persons facing a difficult challenge or predicament which they then try to overcome whilst being cheered on by the player-controlled characters to the tune of a song. Therefore, a Storyboard can take various directions depending on the player’s performance. [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") storyboarding is supported through the use of a scripting language or the [Storyboard Editor](Storyboard_Editor "wikilink") which can be accessed in [Editor](Editor "wikilink") Mode under "Design". There is \[//osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewforum.php?f=20 a sub-forum dedicated to Storyboards\].

### Storyboard Editor

Can be found under "Design" in [Editor](Editor "wikilink") mode. As the name implies, [storyboards](Storyboarding "wikilink") can be easily created and edited here.

### Stream

A long series of [objects](objects "wikilink"), not necessarily belonging in a single [Combo](Combo "wikilink"), which appear in rapid succession. Also see [\#Deathstream](#Deathstream "wikilink").

### SV

**SV** means "**S**lider **V**elocity", the speed in which the slider moves at in relation to the BPM.

### TAG

<div id="TAG2">
</div>
<div id="TAG3">
</div>
<div id="TAG4">
</div>
Tag difficulties are difficulties that are designed for tag cooperation in multi-play mode. Since each player is responsible for one combo in one turn only, each combo can be separated extremely far, making it nearly impossible to play by a single player, and therefore it becomes a challenge for elite players in terms of precision of jumping. [http://osu.ppy.sh/b/87570&m=0 Example](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/87570&m=0_Example "wikilink")

TAG difficulties are usually named TAG in a beatmap set. TAG2 maps are meant for 2 players while TAG4 maps (the hardest) are meant for 4 players.

Note that tag difficulties are unrankable because they are far too hard to be ranked and are not designed for a single player.

### Tablet

A graphics tablet, an alternative input medium to the computer mouse. A tablet consists of a flat surface on which one can point and drag using an attached stylus. The image of the screen does not appear on the tablet, thus making it different in functionality from a [Touch screen](#Touch_screen "wikilink").

### Tap

To press a button while the cursor is over a [Hit Circle](#Hit_Circle "wikilink"). Tapping Hit Circles at the right moment, as indicated by the [beatmap’s](#Beatmap "wikilink") music and the [Approach Circle](#Approach_Circle "wikilink"), is an essential part of [osu](osu "wikilink")! gameplay. There are many buttons one can use to tap: either mouse button, the z and x keys on the keyboard (see [\#z/x](#z/x "wikilink")), either button on a [Touchpad](#Touchpad "wikilink"), buttons on a [Tablet’s](#Tablet "wikilink") pen, etc.

### Target Practice (TP)

### Test Mode

**Test mode** is a feature in the [beatmap editor](beatmap_editor "wikilink"). This allows the [\#Mapper](#Mapper "wikilink") to test a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") without leaving the [editor](editor "wikilink").

An issue with this is that saving is <u>required</u> before proceeding to test mode. The bigger issue with this is that undo history is forgotten, making it harder to undo changes after using **test mode** (for maps not uploaded).

### Time signature

A musical term indicating how many [beats](#Beat "wikilink") are in each measure and what note value constitutes a single beat. [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") offers two alternative time signatures, which can be selected from the [Timing](#Timing "wikilink") menu: 4/4, which is the one most commonly used, and 3/4, which is selected when the rhythm of the song is of, or similar to, a waltz.

### Timing

Probably the most important requirement for a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") to get [ranked](ranked "wikilink"), as well as the most difficult to accomplish. Timing a beatmap consists of determining the [\#Offset](#Offset "wikilink") and then the [BPM](BPM "wikilink") of the song it uses. On songs where the tempo changes, this needs to be done for every [\#Timing section](#Timing_section "wikilink"). The timing process creates the timeline on which [objects](objects "wikilink") will be placed. Without perfect timing, or at least close enough that the human ear can't tell the difference, it is next to impossible to place objects to the rhythm of the music, which is the entire point of [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink")

### Timing section

A part of a song which follows a different rhythm than the parts preceding and following it. Many songs have a constant tempo and thus a single timing section, but for those which have more, the beatmapper needs to identify any areas where the song [\#BPM](#BPM "wikilink") and/ or [\#Time Signature](#Time_Signature "wikilink") changes and find the [\#Timing](#Timing "wikilink") for each one. Timing sections can also be used even if the rhythm of the song remains constant throughout the beatmap, for example in order to allow the beatmapper to assign different [sample sets](#Sample_Set "wikilink") to different parts of the song. Those are called "inherited timing sections" and are identified by green lines.

### Touch screen

One of the input mediums used by the Nintendo DS and the sole input medium for the [\#DS games](#DS_games "wikilink") [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") is based on. Osu! supports Touch screen functionality, but the hardware required is generally expensive for the average player. A computer whose entire screen functions as a Touch screen is called a Tablet PC (Do not confuse with [\#Tablet](#Tablet "wikilink")).

### Touchpad

A substitute for the computer mouse found on laptop computers. A small rectangular area on which one can drag one’s finger to move the mouse cursor. Due to the way touchpads are designed, they do not work with a stylus or similar devices.

### Universal Offset

The time delay between a) the [object](object "wikilink") graphics and [sample set](#Sample_Set "wikilink") sounds associated with them and b) the point of the song where they should be heard. Universal Offset applies to all songs used in [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") and its value differs according to each system's specifications. After being determined, it doesn't need to be modified again. Incorrectly set Universal Offset causes [timing](#Timing "wikilink") problems in every [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") played or edited. If everything sounds off to you while playing a [ranked](Ranked_beatmap "wikilink") [beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink"), try checking your Universal Offset. Universal Offset is set from the Options Menu.

### upppy

A fast and easy-to-use uploading service coded by [\#peppy](#peppy "wikilink"). If you want to share a file with the [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink") community— forget about depositing it on Rapidshare, Megaupload, ImageShack and the like— just upload it on **upppy** and everyone's happy! :) You can find it \[//up.ppy.sh here\].

### Whistle

A sound effect, part of a [sample set](#Sample_Set "wikilink"), usually reserved for emphasizing and punctuating certain points in a song. Its default form and icon in the [Editor](Editor "wikilink") is that of a blown whistle.

### WIP

Acronym for **W**ork **I**n **P**rogress, a [\#Beatmap](#Beatmap "wikilink") that is, for one reason or another, deemed incomplete by its creator (e.g. incomplete difficulty versions, only one difficulty version, pending correction or suggestions on the timing etc.) WIPs can be submitted through the [BSS](#BSS "wikilink") to the Beatmap Help forum to get comments, feedback and help from [mods](Modding "wikilink") and other users.

Z
-

### z/x

To use the z and x keyboard keys to [\#Tap](#Tap "wikilink") in [\#osu!](#osu! "wikilink"). A very popular alternative to the left and right mouse buttons. During gameplay, while z is pressed, the left mouse button will not work and vice versa. The same applies to the x key and the right mouse button. This can be changed in the options menu.
