## Song Selection Screen

![Song Selection](/wiki/Interface/img/Soloplay1.jpeg)

Note: You can identify the song selection for a specific mode by checking the transparent leitmotif.

![][Osu!]"osu!" is [osu!](Standard "wikilink"), ![][Taiko]"Drum" is [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink"), ![][Ctb]"Apple" is [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink") and ![][Mania]"Piano" is [osu!mania](Mania "wikilink")

Because this screen has too many elements to note by easily noticeable numbers, this section will focus on one part of the screen at a time, starting from the top (left to right) and continuing downwards.

### Beatmap Information

![soloplay2.png](/wiki/Interface/img/Soloplay2.jpeg)

This area displays **information on the beatmap difficulty currently selected.** By default, the beatmap whose song is heard in the osu! jukebox is selected when entering the selection screen. The BPM value listed is the deviation between highest and lowest BPM that occurs in the beatmap (timing section changes). "Objects" is the total number of [Hit Objects](Hit_Objects "wikilink") in the beatmap. A ![][Heart]heart symbol at the upper left denotes a Ranked beatmap while a ![][Fire]flame symbol denotes Approved beatmap. The Unicode title will be used if [allowed non-English metadata at Options under General section](Options#Language "wikilink") and the beatmap itself has Unicode title/artist.

-   Style: {Source} ({Artist}) - {Title} \[{Difficulty selected}\]
