# Interface 

![Introduction screen](/wiki/Interface/img/Intro_static.jpg)

## Main Menu

![Main Menu](/wiki/Interface/img/Introscreen.png)

The \[1\] osu!cookie pulses according to the [BPM](Timing "wikilink") of any song currently playing on the main menu. In addition, bars will extend out of the osu!cookie in accordance to the song's volume. If no song is playing, it pulses at a slow 60 BPM. The elements of the main menu are as follows:

-   \[2\] Click Play (P) or the logo to switch to the Solo mode song selection screen.
-   \[3\] Click Edit (E) to open the Editor mode song selection screen.
-   \[4\] Click Options (O) to go to the Options screen.
-   \[5\] Click Exit (Esc) to exit osu!.
-   \[6\] A random useful tip is displayed below the menu.
-   \[7\] In the lower-left is a link to the osu! website, as well as copyright information.
-   \[8\] Connection result to Bancho! In this picture it is not shown, but the connection result looks like a chain link. 
-   \[9\] In the bottom right are the chat controls (F8 & F9).
-   \[10\] In the upper-right is the osu! jukebox which plays the songs in random order. The top shows the song currently playing. The buttons, from left to right, do as follows:
    - Previous Track
    - Play
    - Pause
    - Stop (the difference between Play and Stop is that Stop will reset the song to the beginning, while Pause simply pauses it)
    - Next Track
    - View Song Info. This toggles the top bar showing the song info between being permanent and temporary. When permanent, the info bar will stay visible until it fades out with the rest of the UI. When temporary, it will disappear a little while after a song has been chosen. It will stay hidden until it is toggled again, or another song plays. 
-   \[11\] The number of beatmaps you have available, how long your osu!client has been running for, and your system clock.

## Song Selection Screen

![Song Selection](/wiki/Interface/img/Soloplay1.jpeg)

Note: You can identify the song selection for a specific mode by checking the transparent leitmotif.

![][Osu!]"osu!" is [osu!](Standard "wikilink"), ![][Taiko]"Drum" is [Taiko](Taiko "wikilink"), ![][Ctb]"Apple" is [Catch the Beat](Catch_the_Beat "wikilink") and ![][Mania]"Piano" is [osu!mania](Mania "wikilink")

Because this screen has too many elements to note by easily noticeable numbers, this section will focus on one part of the screen at a time, starting from the top (left to right) and continuing downwards.

### Beatmap Information

![soloplay2.png](/wiki/Interface/img/Soloplay2.jpeg)

This area displays **information on the beatmap difficulty currently selected.** By default, the beatmap whose song is heard in the osu! jukebox is selected when entering the selection screen. The BPM value listed is the deviation between highest and lowest BPM that occurs in the beatmap (timing section changes). "Objects" is the total number of [Hit Objects](Hit_Objects "wikilink") in the beatmap. A ![][Heart]heart symbol at the upper left denotes a Ranked beatmap while a ![][Fire]flame symbol denotes Approved beatmap. The Unicode title will be used if [allowed non-English metadata at Options under General section](Options#Language "wikilink") and the beatmap itself has Unicode title/artist.

-   Style: {Source} ({Artist}) - {Title} \[{Difficulty selected}\]
