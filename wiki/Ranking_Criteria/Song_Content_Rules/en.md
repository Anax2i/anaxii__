Song Content Rules
==================

With a wide variety of music available, most tracks will be fine for use in osu!, providing that they are not:

- Intensely explicit, suggestive, or otherwise extremely confrontational in regards to shocking, obscene or highly sexual content
- Glorifying, promoting or otherwise encouraging drug abuse, suicide, murder, or self-harm
- Promoting racial tension or division
- Extremely and unbearably loud or excessively clipped

Tracks with explicit lyrics can still be used so long as they do not overtly violate the criteria above.

They will need to be identified by a line in the beatmap's description reflecting the sensitive nature of the content. They must also not have the preview point of the map set to a portion of the song that widely broadcasts said explicit content.

Additionally, any background assets (henceforth referred to as *backgrounds*) must be broadly considered as appropriate for an all-ages audience as per [Community Rule 5](wiki/Rules/en.md#community-rules).

## Understanding if a background is appropriate or not

An beatmap background **MUST NOT** contain any of the following:

* Depictions of excessive violence towards humans, human-like characters or animals
  - Example: imagery that portrays gore, mutilation, severe maiming, wounding or graphical depictions of recent death with an obvious cause present (etc: hanging, asphyxiation, exasanguination/bleeding out)
* Depictions of obvious sexual innuendo in excess
  - Example: imagery that imitates sexual acts on a phallic-like object, such as a cucumber
* Explicit or highly suggestive sexual posturing in any capacity
  - Example: a character in a state of near or partial undress lying atop a bed or another surface with obvious sexual intent/anticipation
* Depictions of any sexual content involving or targeted at minors, or fantasy characters of uncertain/dubious age
  - Example: Any form of overt sexual posturing, innuendo or portrayal from an anime character in the 'loli' style, regardless of their established narrative age
* Erotic nudity or graphic sexual depiction
  - Example: Active sexual intercourse, foreplay, full frontal nudity with genitals clearly visible
* Depictions of drug paraphernalia or consumption of any common contraband substance (cocaine, amphetamines, etc), regardless of legality in your host country
  - Example: bongs, coke spoons, used needles, obvious 'pockmark' bruises suggestive of heavy drug use
* Depictions of widely abhorrent cultural/religious icons intended to deliberately inflame, such as offensive use of Nazi/fascist aligned swastikas, anti-Semetic terminology and symbols, or any other icon or motif that is an active signet or marker of discrimination against a social, racial or political group
  
An beatmap background **may contain some** of the following in limited quantities, subject to common sense and good faith:

* Depictions of swimsuit or 'scant' dress/undress so long as such imagery is not highly excessive or in violation of the posturing & innuendo rules listed above
  - Good example: A particularly busty anime character enjoying some time on a dock with her seagull companion
  - Unacceptable example: Three very busty anime characters wearing similar swimsuits with their breasts poised in obvious presentation, with said imagery occupying more than a third of the image's total scene
* Imagery of mild to moderate violence without excessive gore or bloodshed
  - Good example: Two characters from a boxing anime actively fighting one another with bruises, swelling, and some blood present
  - Unacceptable example: A sword fighter removing a limb from an opponent's body with much blood present
* Tasteful depiction of sexual "assets" not done to the extremes
  - Good example: Motion-oriented clothing movement that exposes the front or back of the upper thighs, clothing that exposes a reasonable amount of cleavage, shirtless male characters (with or without nipples)
  - Unacceptable example: Both genders attired in microkini swimsuits, pasties or other stickers, bandages or adhesive material covering genitals
* Depiction of obviously artistic nudity within the context of a given work or domain
  - Good example: Pairing classic Salvador Dali art containing mild nudity to a work cited to be inspired by said piece, or that otherwise houses an obvious, discernible reference to it
  - Bad example: Using a nude model or figure with a work that has no obvious link to the piece, such as on an unrelated anime opening or ending theme
 * Depiction of romantic or intimate acts within an acceptable narrative context
  - Good example: The MC of a given anime and his love interest holding hands or sharing a kiss
  - Bad example: Characters engaged in heavy petting, French kissing or implied masturbation with genitals visible or not

The anecdotal 'rule of thumb' is that one should generally be comfortable with their family members or other judgmental authority figure viewing the piece and be capable of adequately explaining what is going on in the scene. This is by no means a strict requirement, but it is a good way to help inform your decisions on what is and isn't appropriate.

In situations whether the appropriateness of a given background is unclear, the mapper must submit a formal request to any Beatmap Nominator for further appraisal, who will then refer the issue to the Global Moderation Team to decide based on a supermajority (>70%) consensus.

Once a consensus is met and issued, the resulting ruling on its appropriateness is final and can not be challenged under any circumstances, unless edits are made to try and fix the contentious issues cited by the ruling. Any number of these subsequent requests may be made within reason, so long as a good faith effort is being made to try and fix the issues listed.

Should the alteration exceed the limits of common reason or is deemed to be performed in bad faith (such as excessive or poorly-done censoring), the base image may be denied from further appraisal requests and thus deemed unusable for beatmap background images. This is non-contestable and irreversible.
  
## Mapping tracks with explicit lyrics

This is a mildly complicated issue and what is acceptable for one person is often not for another.

To address this, roughly apply a variant of the **20% rule** - is more than 20% of your track's lyrical content a direct reference to something explicit, suggestive, or otherwise controversial?

If you aren't sure on how to proceed with your track given this rough variant, ask any member of the [Quality Assurance Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/7) or [Global Moderation Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4) _before_ uploading your mapset!

Any track that is highly intense or shocking in any manner as described in the three criteria above is not allowed regardless of what percentage of its content falls under the classification.

What determines "highly intense" should be abundantly obvious to a large selection of random people.

## What happens if my track isn't okay?

Any beatmap containing a disallowed track will be removed from the website.

Each time your submission is removed, you will be afforded an explanation by the presiding member of the [Quality Assurance Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/7) or [Global Moderation Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4) responsible for the removal with reasoning justifying the removal.

You may contest this with them via PM if you so wish, or seek the opinions of others to substantiate your claim to the track's suitability. If you still cannot find common ground on this front, your claim may be escalated to a consensus vote among the current QAT, who will collectively decide if your track is acceptable or not.

Excluding severely inappropriate uploads, all users are given a **one submission leeway** before penalties are handed out due to the uncertain nature of this ruling.
After this leeway has passed, users who continually choose to upload inappropriate tracks will face a 42-hour infringement along with the removal of their submission.
