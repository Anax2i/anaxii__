#Forum

The forums are a place where the [osu!](/wiki/Disambiguation/osu!) community can discuss a variety of topics in the form of induvidual threads. 

The [forum index](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums) is generalised under a hierarchy:
Forum -> Category (e.g; osu!) -> Section (e.g; development) -> Subforums (e.g; completed projects) -> Individual threads
