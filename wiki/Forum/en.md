#Forum

The forums are a place where the [osu!](/wiki/Disambiguation/osu!) community can discuss a variety of topics. 

The [forum index](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums) is generalised under a hierarchy:
Forum -> Category (e.g; osu!) -> Section (e.g; development) -> Subforums (e.g; completed projects) -> Individual threads

One of ther main functions of the forums is to assist with [beatmap moderation](/wiki/Modding) where users get feedback and help to improve their beatmaps. 



<!-- TODO: needs more on what the forums are and their purpose within osu!, maybe explain the purpose of each category, brief rundown of concepts relating to the forums: user groups, user rights, formatting, etc -->

<!-- TODO: Links -->
