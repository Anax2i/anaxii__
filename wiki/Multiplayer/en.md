# Multiplayer
![Flowchart of a multi game][Multi_flowchart image]

## Introduction
Multiplayer was implemented on the 3rd of June 2008 (3.6.08) under [osu! Public Release b335][Release b335], and is a game mode in which up to sixteen players can compete against each other on a single map decided by the host.

[osu!academy][osu!academy wikilink] covered this page in [Episode 6 (6:52)][osu!academy Ep6] along with [Online Users Panel][Chat_Console#Extended_Chat_Console wikilink].

## How to enter
### Minimum requirements
- Decent online connection.
- osu!account logged into Bancho (should be done automatically)
- Have a fair amount of beatmaps in your Songs folder (unless you prefer to download as you go)
- Knowing [how to transfer beatmaps without leaving the room.][Beatmaps2 wikilink] [Picture example here.][Beatmaps_peppy image]
- Logical thinking (knowing when to ask about something you don't understand)

### Ways to enter
From Main menu,
- Press "**Play**" then "**Multi**"; or
- Press "**P**" then "**M**". (from Keyboard)

You will be directed to the "**lobby**", the core of the Multi-play.

### Notes
- Keep in mind that downloading times can range from a few seconds to 15mins depending on your internet connection.
- Losing connection to Bancho will send you back to Main Menu until connection is recovered to Bancho. This will force you to be considered "Quit" when playing a match.
- "Quit" when playing a match.
- Requires [osu!supporter][osu!supporter wikilink] in cuttingedge build.

## Lobby

-   Here is a list of things that a player can do in the lobby:-
	-   Press one of the tabs above to sort out the game style they want.
	-   Selecting the few options below the tab to sort out the list.
	-   Creating a new "room" by pressing "New Game"
	-   Press "Quick Join" to randomly join a room based on the beatmap you have.
	-   Press one of the "room" to enter that "room" group.
	-   Talk with other players using the chat console which are opened by default. Please be at your best behavior at all time.
		-   You will be connected to \#lobby by default.

	- There will be warning arrows when it is your turn and the combo will be in colour until your combo ends.
	- You can adjust your own combo colour at Match Setup.
- **Everyone must do the spinner regardless whether it's their turn or not.**
	- Refusal or unable to complete the spinner will break the current combo count.
- If a player quits, [Auto][Auto wikilink] will take over the "Quit" player.
- When you use [SD][Sudden Death wikilink]/[PF][Perfect wikilink], your Interface's HP bar will seem drained out to oblivion because of your teammate's mistake.
	- If the teammate in question did not use [SD][Sudden Death wikilink]/[PF][Perfect wikilink], the beatmap will continue.
	- If the user(assume you) of [SD][Sudden Death wikilink]/[PF][Perfect wikilink] made a mistake, the _actual effect will happen_, causing everyone to be kicked to results screen immediately.
