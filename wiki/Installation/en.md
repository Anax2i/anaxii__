# Installation

Installing the osu! client is the practically the first step to enjoying osu!

## Minimum System Requirements

-   .NET framework 4+
    -   The installer should prompt you to download this if you don't have it. If not, [you can find it here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130).
-   osu! should run on just about any hardware, as long as you supply a graphics card of some sort.

## osu! client

1.  Download the [osu! installer](/home/download).
2.  Locate and run the installer.
3.  When the installer is completed, osu! will open automatically.
4.  When osu! is opened, osu! will prompt you to log in or to sign up.
5.  If you had already created an account, log in (skip to [installing beatmaps](#beatmaps)). If not, click `Create an account`, this will redirect you to the osu!web for registration (continue to step 6).
6.  Complete the [registration](/wiki/registration).
7.  Go back to the osu! client and log in.
8.  From this point, you can now download and play [beatmaps](/wiki/beatmaps) by yourself or with others; and edit and upload [beatmapsets](/wiki/beatmapsets) you create.

## Beatmaps

There are various ways to obtain beatmaps (`.osz` files):

-   [osu!direct](/wiki/osu!direct)
    -   the in-game beatmap downloader (requires [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter))
    -   these are handled automatically
