- Any player who has a flag of a country that is part of the [Francophonie](http://www.world-territories.com/ttfr/dossiers.php?dossier=francophonie) or part of the [Overseas France](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_d%27outre-mer) is allowed to play in this tournament.
- Any staff member except **map selectors and referees** are allowed to play in this tournament.
- 32 slots will be open for each division. In the case a division does not get 32 players, then only the top 16 of this division will be allowed to play in this tournament. If a division has less than 16 players, the tournament for it will be **cancelled**. More slots will not be open. Players can join **any** of the 4 tournaments.
- This tournament's staff has any right to decline the registration of a player if osu! staff declines them.

### Match Progression

#### Preparation

- Referees must make the room 10 minutes prior to the scheduled match time. The referee must contact the players on Discord to remind them their match is beginning soon.
- The room's name's format for every tournament is: o!2MF: (Player 1) vs (Player 2)
- The match is considered a forfeit exactly 10 minutes after the scheduled match time. The player who has not come into the room after these 10 minutes will be considered the loser, whereas the player who was in the lobby will win the match by forfeit. If both players do not come, the winner will be the higher seed between both players.

#### Warmup phase

- Every player is allowed one warmup map each per match. **They must be available on osu! servers and be less than 5 mins of drain time**. Warmups having [questionable content](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules) will not be allowed.

#### Bans and Picks

- Following the warmup phase, players will have to use the !roll command in the multiplayer chat. The player with the lowest roll will have the first ban and second pick, whereas the player with the highest roll will have the first pick and second ban. There will be **two bans** per player for each round.

#### Match Format

- Players must alternate map picks until a winner is determined. Matches will be played in a Best-Of-X format depending on the rounds, noted down here:
  - Round Of 32 and Round Of 16: Best-Of-7 (First to 4 points)
  - Quarterfinals: Best-Of-9 (First to 5 points)
  - Semifinals: Best-Of-11 (First to 6 points)
  - Finals and Grand Final: Best-Of-13 (First to 7 points)
- A player will not be allowed to ban **two maps** from the same mod. (Example: Player 1 bans a HD map, so he must ban another mod afterwards. Player 2 is allowed to ban a HD map as well though.)
- If scores on a map end as a tie, the map will be nullified, and the player who picked it will be allowed to choose either another map, or replay this same map.
- In the case player are tied on match point, the mappool's Tiebreaker will be played.

### Rescheduling

- Players will be allowed to reschedule their match if needed, if they can show proof that their opponent is okay with it, and if it's done **before the Thursday of each week at 23:59UTC**. This is to ensure that staff can adjust their planning to the reschedules. No reschedule after this date will be allowed, unless if the player asking for a reschedule has a valid reason.

### Disconnections

- Disconnections are a thing that can happen at any time for anyone in this tournament. To manage this, we've made some rules which are the following:
  - If the player disconnects within the first 10 seconds of the map being played, the game will be aborted, and the map replayed.
  - If the player disconnects within the first 30 seconds of the map being played, the game will still go on, but both players will have to decide if they want to replay the map, or if the map will count towards the match's points.
  - If the player disconnects after the first 30 seconds of the map being played, the game will go on, and will count towards the match's points.
  - To avoid an abuse of this system, each player will be allowed up to one disconnection per match. Any disconnection after this first disconnection will be a point for the opponent. (Applies only to disconnections during maps)
  - Players will have 10 minutes maximum to come back in the room following a disconnection. If the player does not coem back, the match's score will be frozen and considered the official result. **If the player winning the match is the one disconnected, the match will continue, as long as the opponent is still here to play. If after 30 minutes, the player has not come back, he will be disqualified from the match.**

### Players and staff behaviour

- This is very simple. Players and staff must have read this ruleset in its entirety. Any person participating n this tournament must be respectful of everyone. People will be banned and blacklisted if that is not respected. This counts for players as much as it counts for staff.
