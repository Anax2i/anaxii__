### Tournament play

#### Process overview

1. A referee will create a multiplayer room 10 minutes in advance. Players must join the lobby in that period.
   - The room settings are `Game mode: "osu!mania"`, `Team mode: "Team Vs"` and `Score mode: "ScoreV2"`. The room name must follow the pattern of `CbC: ({Red Team}) vs ({Blue Team})`. The team mentioned first in the room name must be the red team, the team mentioned second in the room name must be the blue team.
   - If no referee is available at match time, the match will be postponed.
2. If less than the minimum amount of required players are present at match time, it can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If, after this period, there are still not enough players for either, a *win by default* will be declared for the team with the most members present.
   - The minimum amount of required players is defined as the amount of players needed to play a beatmap.
3. After both teams present, each team is free to select up to one warm-up map.
   - *The warm-up is optional.*
   - Warm-up map must be osu!mania 4K specific maps and havea drain time of **3:00 or less**.
4. After all warm-up map played, each captain must use `!roll` once in `#multiplayer`. The winner of the `!roll` decides if they want to pick first or protect and ban first.
5. Each captain can ban **one beatmap** from the pool by orders mentioned above. These beatmaps cannot be picked by any team during the entire match.
6. Then, Map picks will alternate between each team.
   - Each mappool has one tiebreaker, except Qualifier. tiebreaker could not be picked and will only be played if both teams need one more point to win the match.
   - Possible mod choices for all maps are Hidden, FadeIn, Flashlight, and Mirror.
7. Captains will **not** be allowed to play by default. 
   - Each team gets 1 substitute to allow their captain to play one map each during the match.
     - *The chance is optional.*
     - This must be done at the time of picking a map. 
     - If one team substitutes their captain into a pick, the other team's captain **must play** in that pick as well. This means during each match, both captains can play a maximum of 2 picks. 
     - Captains will also be **allowed to play during a tiebreaker map**.
   - Exchanging other players during games is allowed without limitations.
8.  Teams will have 2 minutes to pick or ban a beatmap, and 2 minutes to get ready. If a team takes more time than allotted, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
   - For the first occurrence:
     - The team will receive a verbal warning from the referee
   - On subsequent occurrences:
     - For substitutes, the captain forfeit to play this map.
     - For map bans, the captain forfeits the ban.
     - For map picks, a random map will be chosen using the `!roll` command from the remaining mappool, excluding the tiebreaker map.
     - For a ready timer, the referee will issue the `!mp start 10` command, regardless of how many players from each team are present in the lobby, using `!mp kick` on any extra players for each team, starting from the top (i.e. the first valid player combination for each team will be forced to play the pick). The results for such games are to be taken as is.
   - Repeat offenders may receive further sanctions from the host.
   - Each team will receive **one** "tactical timeout" of **two minutes**, to be used as extra time to pick or ban a beatmap. *The tactical timeout is optional.*


#### Results, Disconnects
1. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a beatmap is considered as passing it.
2. If a game ends in a draw, it will be nullified and the map will be replayed.
3. Teams may ask for a rematch if a team member encounters technical difficulties while playing.
   - "Lag spikes" are not considered a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
   - If a rematch happens, the original roster for each team during that particular beatmap must remain the same. If that is not possible, *both* teams will be allowed to swap rosters.
4. If a player disconnects, their scores will not be counted towards their team's total, unless adequate proof of said score is provided, vaild proof are player point-of-view live stream snippets, scores on mp links, in-game replays (which the timestamps must exactly match the time at which the game took place), and official stream.
5. If a player disconnects between beatmaps and the team cannot provide a substitute, the match can be delayed for up to 10 minutes (limited to once per team, per match), if still, a *win by default* decaler for opposite team.
