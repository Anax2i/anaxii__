### Match Organisation

1. In Round of 64, you need to win 4 beatmaps to win a match. (Best-of-7)
2. In the Round of 32 and the Round of 16, you need to win 5 beatmaps to win a match. (Best-of-9)

5. Referees will be holding host during the matches. Players will state their bans and picks in the MP chat, and the referees will select the maps.
6. The referees host multiple lobbies and tournaments at the same time and will not always know every map or their details. Please use the map's full name or terms such as `[mod][map number]` (using the `mappool` on the website tab as reference) to reduce possible confusion. Asking the referee to select maps that as examples; describe its background or reference will reduce your chances of getting the map you wish for.
   - For FreeMod picks, each player needs to pick at least one mod from: Hidden/HardRock/Easy/Flashlight. Multiple mods are allowed. These same mods are allowed to be used on the Tiebreaker.

### Stage Instructions

#### Qualifiers

1. The Qualifiers will be played in **groups of 4.** Each group will have a Top seed and one lower seeded player of each category.
2. We will **not be able to reschedule** your matches for the qualifiers, so make sure you are available before registering.
3. The match lobbies will be created around **5 - 10 minutes** ahead of the schedule.
4. If a player fails to join the lobby past 10 minutes of his scheduled match, we will declare the match a forfeit.
5. There will be no warmups, so make sure you are prepared before your matches!
6. Participants in the lobby will `!roll`. The picks are then done in descending order of the `!roll` scores.
7. Participants will play 8 maps, each of them picking twice in the same order.
8. After each map, the players are awarded points depending on their lobby ranking on the map:
   - 1st place - 4 points
   - 2nd place - 2 points
   - 3rd place - 1 points
   - 4th place - 0 points
9. Only the 2 players with the most points will advance to the next stage. In case of a point tie, the Tiebreaker will be played in 1v1 between the advancing players.
10. If any participants experienced a disconnection in the middle of play from Bancho, the player from the match will be awarded no points for the pick. The players are then given 5 minutes after the disconnection to contact their referee via osu! or Discord before being counted a loss.

#### Rounds

1. The match lobbies will be created around **5 - 10 minutes** ahead of the schedule.
2. If a player fails to join the lobby past 10 minutes of his scheduled match, we will declare the match a forfeit.
3. There will be no warmups, so make sure you are prepared before your matches!
4. Each player will `!roll`. The highest roll decides the pick and ban order (first to ban will be the last to pick).
5. In case of a tie, the Tiebreaker will be played. Losers in the Winners bracket will go to the Losers bracket.
6. If any participants experienced a disconnection in the middle of play from Bancho, a rematch of that same map may be played at the referee's discretion. The players are given 5 minutes after a disconnection to contact their referee via osu! or Discord before being counted a loss.
7. Rescheduling is allowed, however we ask of you to contact your opponent by yourself and then send us a proof that both of you are having an aggrement to reschedule. You can do so by posting a message on the `#rescheduling` text-channel on [#GO Discord server](https://discord.gg/trnFByC) with both you and your opponent acknowledging it. The deadline for rescheduling is on the Thursday 7PM (UTC) of the upcoming week of your match.

2. *Toxic* behaviour during matches will be highly reprimanded and may result in an **auto-loss, kick, or blacklist.**
