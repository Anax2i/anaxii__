# Tournaments

This is where wiki articles for tournaments live, both official and community-run. You are welcome to add new tournaments here, but you should have approval from the tournaments' host(s) before doing so.

Read the ["contributing" file](/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're a new contributor to osu-wiki. If you have any questions about tournament articles, ask in the `#osu-wiki` channel of the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) or [open an issue](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/issues/new).

## Using the template

It's usually easiest to start from the [tournament template](TEMPLATE.md) if you're adding a new tournament:

1. Make a new directory for the tournament or tournament series. The directory name should be the acronym or short name of the tournament. If the tournament is a series, create another directory under that named after the tournament's iteration in the series.

   Examples:

   - osu! World Cup 2014 is in the `OWC/2014` directory
   - Catch French Cup 2 is in the `CFC/2` directory

2. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to the tournament directory, and rename it to `en.md`. If you are adding a new tournament series, copy `TEMPLATE-SERIES.md` into the series directory, and rename it to `en.md` as well.

3. Fill in the placeholders in each of the new files with the tournament's information. Examples are given in parenthesis:

   - `{TITLE}`: Title of the tournament (osu! World Cup 2014)
   - `{SHORT_TITLE}`: Acronym or short name of the tournament (OWC 2014)
   - `{SERIES_TITLE}`: Title of the series (osu! World Cup)
   - `{ITERATION_DIRECTORY}`: Directory name of the iteration (2014)

   Double-check the grammar and wording around placeholders; the tournament may require some changes depending on how the title is written.

4. Read through the files and replace any examples with writing specific to the tournament. There are some comments in the files to help; you can remove them after you've read them.
