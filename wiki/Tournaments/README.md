# Community Tournaments

This is the place where tournaments that have been [given approval](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xRV_F4mbJzEPlxaoXAsaK4cTPK5emlHdbXG43uVvwFg) can add a wiki page for their tournament. 

## Contributing

We don't provide a template to use since tournaments vary in structure from the official world cups. We urge you look at the world cup pages (e.g. [TWC 2017](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/blob/master/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2017/en.md)) as a reference for how an acceptable tournament wiki page should look.

Please make sure to read the README on the [front page of this repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki) for other contributing guidelines.

## Contributors

Community tournament pages may only be accepted if the tournament has been given permission. Tournaments that have been given permission may be found here:  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xRV_F4mbJzEPlxaoXAsaK4cTPK5emlHdbXG43uVvwFg

You can assume for now that all tournaments that have been given wiki permissions have also been awarded a badge.
