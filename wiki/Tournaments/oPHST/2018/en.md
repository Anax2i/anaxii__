### Eligibility and Registration 

#### General Guidelines 

- Players who currently have the ![][flag_PH] Philippine Flag on their profile or players who do not have the Philippine Flag on their profiles but **can present a proof of their Philippine Citizenship** to the staff are the only ones allowed to join the tournament, **regardless of rank on the game mode they are participating in**. There is no requirement for the player to understand the Filipino Language as a whole in order to be permitted. 

- Players who have shown exemplary performances over the previous months shall be given an invitation to join the tournament and shall be reserved a registration slot upon acceptance. 

- Staff Members who are **not part of the Executive Committee and the Mappool Selectors** are permitted to join the tourney. 

- The registration phase of the tournament shall begin on April 2, 2018 and end on April 15, 2018. Only thirty-two (32) slots are opened for each tournament and players are either invited or asked to sign a registration form (invited players will be given priority), and will be seeded according to a criteria that is to be decided by the tournament organizers as they see fit. Players are allowed to join ANY of the four tournaments. 

- **The tournament staff has the right to revoke a player's registration if there is enough evidence against them**. 

#### Qualifier Round for osu!mania 4K and 7K 

- All players that enter the tournament osu!mania 4K and 7K divisions are obliged to play in the qualification round in order to cut down to participants to thirty-two (32) players. This round shall also serve as the division's seeding phase.

- Players are scheduled alongside each other to play a mini-pool of 4 notecharts twice in a multiplayer room. The notecharts are specially-made for the qualifying round of the tournament and are only uploaded minutes before the Qualifier pools are revealed. All players are obliged to play ALL of the notecharts during the qualifiers as FAILED SCORES WILL STILL COUNT. In case a player appears late on his schedule, they shall be allowed to catch up after the rest of the notecharts have been played, but if the second iteration has started, the player will not be allowed to join anymore and must arrange a reschedule before the set match deadline for the weekend. 

- The room name format is as follows: ``oPHST18: (Group X)``. The rooms are made ten minutes prior to the schedule and the referees are obliged to invite you, the player, to the qualifier room at that time. 

- Players are to be ranked according to the weighted average of their Score Rating (illustrated [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1etUNr3BI9a_kW4ysruo2mTNI3QOh_R2VZ5rnZE_TPQs/edit#gid=1590909217)) on each notechart. This is to take into consideration the variation created by the difficulty spread of the pools, and will pool players according to their overall performance.

### Match Proper 

#### Preparation

- The referees shall prepare the match room ten (10) minutes prior to the match schedule. It is the referee's obligation to inform the players about this and be invited to the room. If the player does not respond within this time period, the player is forcibly moved at the actual match schedule.

- The room name format for the three tournaments is: ``oPHST18: (Player 1) vs (Player 2)``

- Defaulting time is ten (10) minutes directly after the actual match schedule. The player who fails to appear in the match within that time period shall be considered as a no-show and the player inside the room already shall be declared the winner. If both players do not appear, the player with the higher seed shall be considered the winner. 

- It is asked of the players to allow non-friend PM's in order for the invites to arrive.

#### Warm-up Phase

- Each Player is allowed to select warm-up charts for them to play in the room in whatever purpose they have. These **must be uploaded to the osu! servers and have less than four (4) minutes of drain time**. Warm-ups that contain questionable content (as defined by the [osu! Community Rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Rules)) shall be disallowed.  

#### Bans and Picks 

- After the warm-up phase, the players shall proceed to use the !roll command on the multiplayer chat. The player with the lower !roll score will ban a notechart from the pool first, and the player with the higher !roll score will place his own ban next, and immediately, his/her first pick. This means that there will be only **one (1) ban from each player**.

#### Match Format 

- Players shall alternate picks until a match winner is determined. This shall be in a Best-of-X series with the formats listed as follows: 

	- Round of 32/o!m Group Stage - Best-of-7 (First to 4) 
	- Round of 16/o!m Quarterfinals - Best-of-9 (First to 5) 
	- Quarterfinals/o!m Semifinals - Best-of-11 (First to 6) 
	- Semifinals/o!m Finals Week 1 - Best-of-13 (First to 7) 
	- Finals/o!m Finals Week 2 - Best-of-13 (First to 7) 

- For osu!standard, the players are **prohibited from consecutively picking maps from the same mod bracket on their turn to pick**. 

- In case the players are tied at match point, for example, a 3-3 on a Best-of-7 match, the players the proceed to play the Tiebreaker chart of the pool. 

#### Mappools 

- Each round has its own mappool, with increasing difficulty as the tournament progresses. For osu!standard and osu!catch, the mappool is made to accomodate the mods to be used as explained in their respective sections in these rules.

- For osu!mania 4K and 7K, the mappool is made to accomodate enough for a double match point, one ban per player, an ignored pick, and the tiebreaker. The Loser's Bracket Finals will be played using the Finals Week 2 mappool. 

### Rescheduling 

- Players are allowed to reschedule their matches as long as their opponent have a mutual agreement on this arrangement, and is **made before the Thursday prior to the match**. This is for the staff to be able to adjust their general schedules for the round, including the streams. If the arrangement is made after the set deadline, the match will still be rescheduled, but there is no assurance that it will be streamed. 

- For reschedules made after the deadline, the staff shall only consider this if given a valid reason (academics, sickness, family matters) with proof. 

### Disconnections 

- In case disconnections happen during a match, the following guidelines are given:

	- If the player disconnects within 10 seconds of the drain time of the pick (the pick is being played), the play will be aborted and shall be repeated once the player re-enters, or gets moved into the room.
	- If the player disconnects within 30 seconds of the drain time of the pick, the play shall continue BUT it will be decided by both players whether to repeat the play, or the play be counted as part of the scoreboard. 
	- If the player disconnects beyond 30 seconds of the drain time of the pick, the play shall continue and will be counted as part of the scoreboard. 
	- In order to avoid abuse of the system, each player has only one (1) disconnection token per match and is used up once the player does. Any disconnection made after the token is used shall be counted as a point for their opponent. (Only applies for disconnections during the play) 
	- Players are only given 10 minutes to return to the room upon disconnection. If the player fails to return, the match score shall be frozen and will be considered the official result.
	- If the player who leads the score is the one who disconnected, the match shall continue, regardless of the player's time of return, and as long as the opponent is present. If the said player fails to return within 30 minutes after disconnection, the player shall be disqualified from the match. 
	- Situations uncovered by these clauses (stuck at "Waiting for Other Players" screen, Player disconnection a few seconds prior to score submission, etc.) shall be decided immediately by the staff on-the-spot. 
	
### Player and Staff Conduct 

- Players are expected to be informed about the Rules and Guidelines of this tournament. In addition, the staff shall assure a good experience for the players during the tournament. 

#### Match Conduct 

- The Players and staff are expected to adhere to the Rules and Regulations of the osu! Community. If the player's behavior during the match is not tolerable anymore, the staff has the decision whether to terminate the match and freeze at current score, disqualify the player from the match, or disqualify the player in the tournament as a whole. The staff also have the discretion to change the referee of the match, or kick him/her out of the staff based on the same grounds. 

#### Overall Conduct 

- The players and staff are expected to not be a douche. If the player is seen to be disconnecting from the match without proper justification, the staff may decide to impose the penalties to their discretion. Also, if the player is in a match that determines the Top 3 of the tournament, regardless of division, and no-shows on that match without proper justification, the player shall be deemed disqualified from the tournament as a whole, and the tournament rankings shall be adjusted accordingly.

- If the staff member is the one who's at fault, it is the Executive Committee's decision on which penalties the said staff member faces. This may include suspension or termination from service. 

- In addition, the staff are not accountable if the player is silenced or restricted during the course of the tournament. In case of the former, the silence duration shall be considered as either the defaulting time, or disconnection time. Thus, if the silence lasts for more than 10 minutes, the said player is deemed to have lost the match by default. 

### Updates and Concerns 

- Most of the major updates regarding the tournament shall be posted on this forum thread. All concerns and questions regarding the tournament may be posted on this thread, or via the official osu!Philippines Facebook Group.

## Changes from Previous Editions

### Addition of osu!standard and osu!catch 

- Initially, this tournament would have been just an osu!mania tournament, similar to the [previous](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/437448) [two](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/579557) editions. Though after the success of the [osu!Philippines Holiday Friendlies 2017](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/640068), [Zaphirox](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2478675) has suggested adding osu!standard (and later, with [Lobsterr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6575915)'s go signal, osu!catch) to the fray. With a few modifications to the rules introduced, this tournament series was born.

### "National Championships" 

- The amount of prestige this tournament has been given outside the osu!PH community, this has been considered as the community's flagship competition, hence calling it such is considerable.

### Player Eligibility 

- Starting with the recently finished [osu!Philippines Holiday Friendlies 2017](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/640068),  we have been less strict with the PH flag requirement for registration eligibility. This is to improve player interest and turnout. Though what we'll be strict on will be their proof of Philippine Citizenship, which would be similar to how osu! Staff deals with the profile flag changes. Players will be asked to present identification along with an open osu! client where they are logged in before allowing their participation. 

### Qualification Criteria (osu!mania) 

- During the staff discussions on the [Springtime osu!mania 4k Free-for-all Tournament](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Tournaments/SOFT/3) Qualification Criteria, there have been plans on adopting changes based on how the meta has shifted ever since its first edition. This has made variations on the scores obtained much more prevalent on recent tournaments which have used the same qualifier format, which omPHST has followed to during its past two editions. There have been proposals to move from the aggregate score format which has been used for the past two years to another seeding criteria. Some of which discussed were **(Weighted) Average of ranks** or a proposed **Score Rating System** (illustrated [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1etUNr3BI9a_kW4ysruo2mTNI3QOh_R2VZ5rnZE_TPQs/edit#gid=1590909217)) by ![][flag_SG] [Shoegazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2520707) which computes a rating of the scores obtained according to which quartile it falls under. The effects of the latter system has been explained on the linked illustration, and for additional data regarding this, the tournament will adopt this system for the qualifiers. 

### Disconnection Clauses 

- It has been observed that computing percentages from the drain time is not practical, hence a definite clause was laid out.
