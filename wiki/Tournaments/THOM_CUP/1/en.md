## Rules

#### Qualification Process

- All players that enter the tournament will be eligible to play in the qualification round. However, the number of participants who will advance to the next round will be cut down to the nearest power of 2. **The maximum number of players who can advance to the subsequent round is 64**. The criterion used to determine whether a player will progress to the next round is their performance in the qualification stage.

  - If 32 players enter, all **32 players will qualify** and no one gets eliminated.
  - If 33 players enter, the worst-performing player gets eliminated and the **top 32 will advance** to the next round.
  - If 49 players enter, the 17 worst-performing players get eliminated and the **top 32 will advance** to the next round.
  - If 63 players enter, the 31 worst-performing players get eliminated and the **top 32 will advance** to the next round.


- The qualification round will have a 4 song mappool that widely varies in difficulty.

- **All four maps will be created by the map selectors and will be unreleased prior to the tournament qualification stage, to provide 0 opportunity for advantage through familiarity**.

- All players will have two chances at each qualifier map, in which the highest of the two runs on each qualifier map will be used to calculate your final score.

- Players will be organized into groups based on their availability. Because qualification is not a process that involves 1 on 1 matchups, it is actually possible to have 8 players go through the qualification process at once. If this is a confusing process, do not worry: simply adhere to the schedule that will be released and follow referee instructions during the match. The purpose of putting you in groups of 8 is to give everyone streaming time, for qualifiers will be streamed as well!

- Regardless of the number of entrants and eliminations, the qualification process will also be done to seed players. Players will be ordered based on their cumulative score on all four songs, with the best score being seed \#1, and the worst score being seed n; n being the number of players in the qualification stage.

- We will be using **Score V2** for all rounds of the tournament.

#### Post-Qualification

- The round after the qualification stage (also known as the play-offs stage) is a **single elimination** stage with specific rules.

- After the qualification round, the remaining players, based on their qualification seeds, will be divided into 4 different groups. Each group will have a different set of protocol to follow.
  - **Top8**: The top 8 seeds of the qualification stage will advance directly into the group stage of the tournament. They do not need to participate in any matches in this stage.

  - **9th-16thÂ° seeds**: Players within this group will participate in one match in the Play-Offs stage. Their opponent will be a player from the 49th to 64th seed group. Players who win their matches in this stage will advance to the Group Stage.

  - **17rd-48th seeds**: Players within this group will participate in one match in the Play-Offs stage. Their opponent will be a player in the 33rd to 96th seed group. In particular, their opponent's seed will be `(65 - player's seed)`. Players who win their match in this stage will advance to the Group Stage.

  - **49th-64th seeds**: Players within this group will participate in **two matches** in the Play-Offs stage. Their first opponent will be a player in the 49th to 64th seed group. In particular, their opponent's seed will be `(113 - player's seed)`. If the player wins their first match, their second opponent will be a player in the 8th to 16th seed group. Players who win both of their matches in this stage will advance to the Group Stage.

#### Group Stage

- After the Play-Offs stage, the remaining players will be divided into 4 different groups based on their qualification seed. These groups will be labelled "Top Seed", "High Seed", "Low Seed", and "Bottom Seed". Groups (for the Group Stage) are then formed by randomly selecting one player from each seed group.

- Each player in these groups will face each other once. In total, every player in the Group Stage will participate in **three matches**. The two best-performing players in each group will advance to the next round.

- A player's performance in the group is determined through these metrics, arranged from highest priority to lowest:
  - Number of matches won.
  - `Number of rounds won - numbers of round lost`.
  - Number of losses by default (lower is better).
  - Higher qualification seed.

- After the Group Stage, the remaining players will be seeded based on their performance in the Group Stage. We use the same metric as the one that we used to determine the two best-performing players in a group, minus the "number of losses by default" metric. This will be used to determine the remaining players' opponents for the next round. In particular, their opponent for the next round will be `(17 - player's GS seed)`

### Tournament Play

#### Protocol

- All matches must have a referee that is listed in the staff section of this tournament unless otherwise noted by myself (*WalterToro*).

- For maximal accountability on myself and my staff, each match will have a primary referee and a back-up referee in the event that the primary cannot make the match. This way we ensure you that there will be someone there to handle your tournament match.

- Overlaps between matches in dense stages might and will happen and because of that, streaming every single map is just not doable. Even then, we will do our best job to get stream time for everyone.

- Matches will be listed in time blocks of a certain duration depending on the stage.

- ***It is your right as a player and tournament entrant to expect that staff will perform to the best of their abilities in moderating matches in such a way that they will conclude in a timely manner***.
  - This means that rooms with matches will be created before the match start time, and you will be invited to the corresponding tournament room before the match start time.

  - If both players arrive on time, tournament proceedings will begin promptly at the start time of the match, no earlier and no later.

  - Take care of any priorities you may have immediately before and/or after the match, as we will be running on a fixed schedule.

  - If it is less than five (5) minutes before your match start time and you have not been invited to your corresponding multiplayer room, find the designated referee for your match in game and send them a message. If they are not available, send a message to the backup referee of the matchup. If for any reason neither of them are available, send me a Discord message at **WalterToro#7634**, with your invitation to add as a contact indicating that you are a player in my tournament and do not have a referee for your matchup. I will mitigate the situation both with your tournament match and unreliability of my team at that point.


- ***It is our right as tournament staff to expect that you will arrive for your matches before your expected time***.
  - Players will be given a ten (10) minute grace period after the match start time to enter their room; if they have not entered by this point, the match will be forfeited and the player that has arrived will win by default.

  - In the extreme circumstance where both players have not shown up, **the player with the higher seed in the match-up will advance automatically**. This is to prevent byes for multiple matches while providing potential for more intense matchups to still be possible.


- ***It is your privilege as a player and tournament entrant to have an opinion about the content/structure used in the tournament***.
  - You are experiencing this event as a competitor, and every choice made in the process directly affects how you will progress in the tournament.

  - If you dislike something, you are allowed to state your dislike -- however, do so reasonably. Speaking in absolutes/matter-of-fact tone is the fastest way for an argument to start, especially over an opinionated statement. Keep in mind that some of your fellow competitors and other users on this website will have content that will inevitably be used in the tournament, and it is best advised that you make it clear that it is your opinion so as to not be hurtful.


- ***It is our right as tournament staff to reprimand users for intolerable behavior***.
  - I will have sole discretion over decisions that affect your standing in the tournament; however, other members of tournament staff may forward any information to me that in any way represents uncalled for behavior towards other users or staff in my tournament. I will attempt to escalate serious situations beyond the scope of this event if need be, so please -- do everyone (and yourself) a favor and be respectful.

  - Minor instances will receive warnings, and continued instances will result in forceful removal from the tournament.

#### Warm-up Songs

- Each player in the match will be allowed one (1) warm-up song to be played, making for two (2) warm-ups total between both players.

- The warm-up must be uploaded to the osu! website and accessible by everyone prior to the tournament match.

- Maps that have a beatmap listing but cannot be downloaded are not allowed for the purpose of warmup.

- Bloodcat links are **not allowed**, and neither are personal links featuring the beatmap that you want downloaded.

- Warm-up songs will be on FreeMod, allowing for any special modifications that you see fit for the purpose of warming up properly.

- In the early stages, your Warm-up cant be longer than 4 minutes. This includes the first 2 stages of the tournament after the qualifiers.

#### Bans, Rolls and Song Selection

- With the exception of warm-ups, all songs played in a given round must match those that are selectable in the corresponding map pool. Maps are to be played on a restrictive FreeMod: only Hidden, Fade In, or Flashlight can be used.

- Players are to ban one (1) map within the map pool that they are playing for the given round.

- Players will be instructed to do a !roll command by the referee that is overseeing the match; the losing roll picks the first banned song, while the winning roll picks the first song of the match.

- After the bans and rolls have concluded, the player with the winning roll instructs the referee of their song selection, and the referee will switch to that song. After that song concludes, the other player will pick a song, and this process will continue until one of the two conditions is satisfied:

  1. One player has achieved enough wins in such a way that the other player cannot successfully win the round.

     - The winning player moves onto the next match.

     - The losing player falls to the loserâs bracket. If a player loses in the loserâs bracket, they are eliminated from the tournament.

  2. Both players are at match point at the same time.

     - Both players will play the song designated as the tiebreaker.

     - The winner of the tiebreaker will progress to the next match of the tournament, while the loser will be eliminated or sent to the loserâs bracket, depending on the position of the tournament.

#### Disconnections

- Maps with a player disconnection that occurs within the first 30 seconds, or 25% of the song (whichever comes first) will be nullified and re-attempted.

- Matches will have a two disconnection limit -- upon the third disconnection, a point will be handed immediately to the player still active within the lobby.

- A two minute timer will be placed on a disconnected player when the song played has concluded. When this timer hits 0, the grace period mentioned in **Protocol** will be (re)activated. If the grace period timer hits 0, the match is forfeited, and the other remaining player will be declared winner.

- Situations with two player disconnections will be executed similarly to two missing players for a given match: the higher seed will be declared the winner if both players have no time left in their grace period.
