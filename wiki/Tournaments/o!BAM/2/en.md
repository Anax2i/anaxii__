## Ruleset

### General rules

1. osu! Battle Archive Malaysia uses a double-elimination bracket and is a 2v2 osu! tournament.
2. Teams can only have 2 players. This means no substitution.
3. The score system used will be **Score V2**.
4. There is no solo rank range. A team rank range using the Badge Weighting System (BWS) is used instead with the following formula: `pp+(1- (rank**(0.9937**(badges**1.75))/rank))*pp`.
5. The 2 players must have an **average BWS PP of 12000pp**.
6. Teams will be seeded by **Qualifier seeding**.
7. Grand Finals will have a **bracket reset** if the team coming from loser's bracket wins the first match.
8. Match schedules and mappools **will be released on the Monday** before those matches should be played.
9. Match schedules will be written in UTC+8.
10. There will be pickems available **internationally** for anyone to have a chance at earning a prize, even if they aren't local.

### Round-specific rules

#### Qualifier

1. Each team captain will have to sign up to one of the Qualifier lobbies that has been scheduled and prepared by the tournament management in advance.
2. In the lobby, all teams will have to consecutively play all of the eleven Qualifier beatmaps in the order of NM1 -> NM2 -> NM3 -> NM4 -> HD1 -> HDHR1 -> HR1 -> HR2 -> DT1 -> DT2 -> DT3.
3. Teams **are not allowed** to join in (or register for) more than one Qualifier lobby.
4. Based on their performance in the Qualifier, players will be ranked based on the amount of Z-Score they accumulate.
   - Z-Score compares your team score relative to the average team score achieved in a map and assigns a value to it. Z-Score is measured in terms of the standard deviation of the team score from the mean team score achieved within that map. If your value is higher than 0, it means that your total team score is more than the average team score on that specific map, and vice versa with values lower than 0.
   - Z-Score is calculated PER MAP. Your Qualifiers standing will be determined by your team's total Z-Score on all 11 maps played, and will be sorted by ascending total Z-Score, with the team with the highest total Z-Score value placing 1st.
5. The 40 teams with the **highest amount of Z-Score in total** will advance to the Group Stage as follows:

| Qualifier ranking | Group Stage |
| :-: | :-- |
| #1 - #8 | **Top Seed** |
| #9 - #16 | **High Seed** |
| #17 - #24 | **Mid Seed** |
| #25 - #32 | **Low Seed** |
| #33 - #40 | **Unseeded** |

6. Failure to attend in any of the predetermined Qualifier lobbies will result in an instant elimination from the tournament.

#### Group Stage

1. In the Group Stage, all previously qualified teams will be divided into 8 groups consisting of 5 different teams each based on their seed.
2. All teams in each group will face each other over two week.
3. All group stage matches will be best of 9 (first to 5 wins).
4. The 1st and 2nd-placed team from each group will qualify to the RO16 winner’s bracket. The 3rd and 4th-placed teams will qualify to the RO16 loser’s bracket. The 5th-placed teams will be eliminated.

#### Knock-out stage rules

1. All remaining will be matched to each other based on their Group Stage placement as described above.
2. Teams will compete against each other using the modified Double Elimination system.
3. The modified Double Elimination System works as follows:
   - Teams who lose in the upper bracket can still play again on the lower bracket.
   - Teams who lose in the lower bracket will be eliminated from the tournament.
4. Teams who can compete in the next round are determined by the following criteria:
   - In the Round of 16 and Quarterfinals, each team needs to win 6 points in order to win a match. (Best-of-11)
   - In the Semifinals and Finals weeks(excluding the Grand Final), each team needs to win 7 points in order to to win a match. (Best-of-13)
   - In the Grand Final, each team needs to win 8 points in order to to win a match. (Best-of-15)
   - Teams who win By default.
   - If there are teams who are disqualified from the tournament.

### Match procedure

1. The match lobby will be created by the referee, and all four players will be invited.
2. Teams have a strict 15-minute grace period to have both players available to play the match. If 15 minutes pass and a team does not have enough players to play the match, the other team will receive a win by default.
3. The referee can give host to the players for warmups only. The referee will clear the host after warmups. A team will select a map by naming the map in the multiplayer chat for the referee to set.
4. Both captains will do a `!roll`. The team with the higher number will get to pick the first map, and then both teams ban a map starting from the team with the lower number.
5. Each team is obligated to ban **two beatmaps** from the mappool, with the first ban given prior to the beginning of the match and the second ban given after 4 maps have been played. These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any player during the entire match.
6. In a FreeMod pick, both players have to apply at least one mods to play the beatmap with. Allowed mods are EZ, HR, HD, FL, or any possible combinations of those four mods.
   - EZ will have their own independent multiplier depending on the FM pick.
   - There is no bonus multiplier for FL.
   - Playing a FreeMod pick with **EZ** + **EZ**, **FL** + **FL** and without any mods activated is not allowed.
7. In case of a tiebreaker, each team will discreetly ban 1 of the 3 remaining available beatmaps from the mappool. This is done by sending an in-game PM with your ban to the match referee. The one beatmap that ends up not being banned by both players will be played as the tiebreaker. 
   - If both players ban the same beatmap, the referee will run the `!roll 2` command in the lobby to determine which of the 2 remaining possible tiebreakers will be played.
8. The results of each match and any other relevant information regarding the match will be posted on the Discord server after the match has been concluded by the responsible referees.
