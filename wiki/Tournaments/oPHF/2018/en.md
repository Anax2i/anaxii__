### Match Proper

#### Preparation

- The referees will prepare the match room ten (10) minutes prior to the match schedule. It is the referee's obligation to inform the players about this and be invited to the room. If the player does not respond within this time period, the player is forcibly moved at the actual match schedule.
- The room name format for the three tournaments is: ``oPHF18: (Player 1) vs (Player 2)``
- Defaulting time is ten (10) minutes directly after the actual match schedule. The player who fails to appear in the match within that time period will be considered as a no-show and the player inside the room already will be declared the winner. If both players do not appear, the player with the higher seed will be considered the winner.
- It is asked of the players to allow non-friend PM's in order for the invites to arrive.

#### Warm-up Phase

- Each Player is allowed to select warm-up charts for them to play in the room in whatever purpose they have. These **must be uploaded to the osu! servers and have less than four (4) minutes of drain time**. Warm-ups that contain questionable content (as defined by the [osu! Community Rules](/wiki/Rules)) will be disallowed.

#### Bans and Picks

- After the warm-up phase, the players will proceed to use the !roll command on the multiplayer chat. The player with the lower !roll score will ban a notechart from the pool first, and the player with the higher !roll score will place his own ban next, and immediately, his/her first pick. This means that there will be only **one (1) ban from each player**.

#### Match Format

- Players will alternate picks until a match winner is determined. This will be in a Best-of-X series with the formats listed as follows:
  - Match Weeks 1 and 2 - Best-of-9 (First to 5)
  - Match Week 3 - Best-of-11 (First to 6)
  - Match Week 4 - Best-of-11 (First to 6)
  - Match Week 5 - Best-of-13 (First to 7)
  - Match Week 6 - Best-of-13 (First to 7)
- For osu!standard, the players are **prohibited from consecutively picking maps from the same mod bracket on their turn to pick**.
- If it so happens that the scores of the two players on a pick are tied, the pick will be nullified. The player who picked the nullified beatmap will be permitted to do a re-pick (of another beatmap), or a replay of the nullified beatmap.
- In case the players are tied at match point, for example, a 3-3 on a Best-of-7 match, the players will proceed to play the Tiebreaker chart of the pool.

#### Mappools and their Construction

- Each round has its own mappool, with increasing difficulty as the tournament progresses. For osu!standard and osu!catch, the mappool is made to accomodate the mods to be used as explained in their respective sections in these rules.
- For osu!mania 4K and 7K, the mappool is made to accomodate enough for a double match point, one ban per player, an ignored pick, and the tiebreaker.
- The Loser's Bracket Finals will be played using the Finals Week 2 mappool of the respective game modes.

### Rescheduling

- Players are allowed to reschedule their matches as long as their opponent have a mutual agreement on this arrangement, and is **made before the Thursday prior to the match**. This is for the staff to be able to adjust their general schedules for the round, including the streams. If the arrangement is made after the set deadline, the match will still be rescheduled, but there is no assurance that it will be streamed.
- For reschedules made after the deadline, the staff will only consider this if given a valid reason (academics, sickness, family matters) with proof.

### Disconnections

- In case disconnections happen during a match, the following guidelines are given:
  - If the player disconnects within 10 seconds of the drain time of the pick (the pick is being played), the play will be aborted and will be repeated once the player re-enters, or gets moved into the room.
  - If the player disconnects within 30 seconds of the drain time of the pick, the play will continue BUT it will be decided by both players whether to repeat the play, or the play be counted as part of the scoreboard.
  - If the player disconnects beyond 30 seconds of the drain time of the pick, the play will continue and will be counted as part of the scoreboard.
  - In order to avoid abuse of the system, each player has only one (1) disconnection token per match and is used up once the player does. Any disconnection made after the token is used will be counted as a point for their opponent. (Only applies for disconnections during the play)
  - Players are only given 10 minutes to return to the room upon disconnection. If the player fails to return, the match score will be frozen and will be considered the official result.
  - If the player who leads the score is the one who disconnected, the match will continue, regardless of the player's time of return, and as long as the opponent is present. If the said player fails to return within 30 minutes after disconnection, the player will be disqualified from the match.
  - Situations uncovered by these clauses (stuck at "Waiting for Other Players" screen, Player disconnection a few seconds prior to score submission, etc.) will be decided immediately by the staff on-the-spot.

### Player and Staff Conduct

- Players are expected to be informed about the Rules and Guidelines of this tournament. In addition, the staff will assure a good experience for the players during the tournament.

#### Match Conduct

- The Players and staff are expected to adhere to the Rules and Regulations of the osu! Community. If the player's behavior during the match is not tolerable anymore, the staff has the decision whether to terminate the match and freeze at current score, disqualify the player from the match, or disqualify the player in the tournament as a whole. The staff also have the discretion to change the referee of the match, or kick him/her out of the staff based on the same grounds.

#### Overall Conduct

- The players and staff are expected to not be a douche. If the player is seen to be disconnecting from the match without proper justification, the staff may decide to impose the penalties to their discretion. Also, if the player is in a match that determines the Top 3 of the tournament, regardless of division, and no-shows on that match without proper justification, the player will be deemed disqualified from the tournament as a whole, and the tournament rankings will be adjusted accordingly.
- If the staff member is the one who's at fault, it is the Executive Committee's decision on which penalties the said staff member faces. This may include suspension or termination from service.
- In addition, the staff are not accountable if the player is silenced or restricted during the course of the tournament. In case of the former, the silence duration will be considered as either the defaulting time, or disconnection time. Thus, if the silence lasts for more than 10 minutes, the said player is deemed to have lost the match by default.

- Most of the major updates regarding the tournament will be posted on the discussion thread. All concerns and questions regarding the tournament may be posted on the thread, or via the osu!Philippines Facebook Group.
