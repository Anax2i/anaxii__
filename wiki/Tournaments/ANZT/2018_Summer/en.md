## Ruleset
### General Rules

* This is an 1v1 double elimination osu!standard tourney for Australian/New Zealand players only.
* Participants must have an Australian or New Zealand flag on their osu profile.
* Matches will be **Head to Head** with **Score V2** as the scoring system.
* Any harassment or abuse of a staff member or other players will result in an expulsion from the tournament.
* If a problem occurs where rules are not clear, use common sense. Further questions can be directed to admins. Administration has final say regarding these situations.
* In order for your registration to count, **you must fill out the form, join the discord, and change your name to your osu username**.
* There is no rank limit for signup and all participants who sign up will play qualifiers. The top 64 players from qualifiers will move on to groups.
* Staff members are not allowed to sign up. The only exceptions are streamers & commentators.
* Reschedules must be **agreed on by both players and proof must be provided**.
* All matches will be scheduled for Friday, Saturday & Sunday.

### Match Rules

* Referees will create the lobby and invite players 10 minutes before the designated match time.
* Players have up to ten minutes after their designated start time to move into the lobby. Failure to show will result in a forfeit. If both players are absent, the match will either be rescheduled or end in double forfeit to the discretion of the administration.
* If a player disconnects within the first 30 seconds of a map, it will be aborted and replayed. Any disconnects afterwards will be a forfeit of that map.
* Disconnects may only occur once per match per player. It will count as a forfeit after the first time.
* Players may not choose from the same mod pool twice in a row (HD/HR/DT/FreeMod). This does not apply to NoMod.
* In a FreeMod pick, each player **must select a mod** (HD/HR/HDHR) or a combination of mods to play with. **NoMod is not allowed**.
* Failed scores will only count if the player revives before the end. If a player fails and their opponent doesnâ€™t, the point goes to the latter. If both players fail, the point goes to the higher failed score.
* If there is a tie, players will play the tiebreaker. Mods can be played (HD/HR/HDHR).

### Qualifier Rules
