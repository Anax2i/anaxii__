## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The GB Cup 2022 Spring is a individual-based tournament, played on the osu!mania game mode.
2. Beatmap scoring will be based on Score V2.
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the Mappool Selector Team on the Monday before the actual matches take place.
   - Each mappool, except for the Qualifier stage, will contain a *tiebreaker* beatmap. It will only be played in case of a tie in the scoreline in the *best of* system, e.g. the scoreline is 4-4 and the match is best of 9, the tiebreaker shall be played.
4. Match schedule will be handled by the Host.
5. If no referees are available at match time, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a beatmap is considered as passing it.
7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
   - Custom skin elements must not be used to alter core gameplay mechanics.
8. If a game ends in a draw it will be nullified and the beatmap replayed, herein called a *rematch*.
9. Teams may ask for a rematch if a team member encounters technical difficulties while playing.
   - "Lag spikes" are not considered a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
   - If a rematch happens, the original roster for each team during that particular beatmap must remain the same. If that is not possible, e.g. by virtue of a technical issue, *both* teams will be allowed to swap rosters.
   - This rule is not to be abused. Referees may veto a rematch request if they find that this is the case.
10. Beatmaps must not be reused in the same match, except for rematches.
12. If players are not present at match time, it can be postponed for up to 10 minutes. If, after this period, there are still not enough players for either, a *win by default* will be declared for the players present.
    - `双方玩家都不在的情况，如何判断胜负？`
12. Players are expected to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Excessive match delays from the players' side may result in penalties being applied.
13. If a player disconnects between beatmaps, the match can be delayed for up to 10 minutes (limited to once per player, per match).
14. All players and staff must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and the Host are to be followed. Decisions labeled as final are not to be objected.

18. The multiplayer chatrooms underlie the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules). All chat rules apply to the multiplayer chatrooms, too.
    - Breaking the chat rules results in a silence. Silenced players cannot participate at multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the time being.
17. Unexpected incidences will be handled by the Tournament Management. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the given circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
