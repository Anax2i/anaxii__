## Match schedules and results

![Schedules](img/schedule_no_number.png)

*Currently no matches have been played / scheduled for UKCC 8.*

## Ruleset

![Rules](img/rules.png)

- The structure of the tournament will be:
  1. Qualifier
  2. Group stage (32 teams)
  3. Double Elimination Bracket (16 teams)
- To be able to participate, players must have an **![][flag_GB] Great Britain or ![][flag_IE] Irish flag or be able to provide proof of residency to the hosts.**
- The total rank of both players must not be below **1,000**. Any teams that do not meet this criteria will be removed from the tournament.
- Matches will be **Team VS** and **Score V2**
- Ranks are used to calculate seeding. Once the tournament starts, your rank is locked and will not affect your seed.
- All staff (With the exception of the Hosts, Mappool Selectors and Referees) are allowed to participate in the tournament.
- All players are to treat staff and other participants with a high level of respect. Any kind of mistreatment on the discord server or during matches (this includes homophobia, racism and toxicity) will result in a BAN and will be BLACKLISTED from participating from future UKCC tournaments.
- ***Where rules do not prevail, common sense shall. The administration has explicit discretion to apply their judgement on this as they see fit.***
- Teams are **REQUIRED** to join the public discord so that they are contactable by other teams and staff. If a player can’t be contacted or is not responding to messages, through discord, ingame messages or forum pms, contact the staff.
- Mappools are to be released the Monday before a stage is due to happen

### Reschedules

- Schedules for the next round are released on the Monday before a stage is due to happen and **ALL** matches will be scheduled for the weekend. You can reschedule for weekdays at the staff’s discretion.
- In order to reschedule, you must contact your opponents, agree on a time and be able to provide PROOF (by form of a screenshot/image) of the agreed reschedule to the Hosts.
- In effort to ensure as many matches take place as possible, reschedules are allowed up to **2 HOURS BEFORE YOUR MATCH IS DUE TO BE PLAYED**. However, your opponent holds the right to **refuse a reschedule if asked less than 12 hours from the scheduled time**
- If it is impossible to find a time to reschedule to that suits both teams, teams should talk to the Hosts (Bae- or Yazzehh) and they will attempt to sort something out.
- Matches that are uncertain to happen (for example, losers’ bracket matches) will still appear on the schedule. They are to be rescheduled if needed in the same way as confirmed matches.
- If a match needs rescheduling to a time after a related losers’ bracket match, the matches relying on the outcome of the rescheduled match will be rescheduled by staff and 24 hours will be given for rescheduling them, if needed.

- Referees will create the lobby approximately **10 minutes** before the match is due to start.
- Players have a 10 minute grace period after their scheduled match time to join the lobby. If a player fails to join the lobby in this time, then the default win will go to the other player. If both players do not show up, both players will recieve losses.
- We take no-shows seriously, if you fail to show up to your match without valid reason, you may forfeit your right to future UKCC tournaments.
- The referee cannot play during the match.

### Rolling

- When both players are in the lobby and ready, the referee will ask the players to !roll. The order of picks of bans is decided using the [UKCC 4 roll system](img/ukcc_roll_system.png).

### Banning

- Qualifiers there are no bans.
- In the group stage, teams will have **one** ban.
- RO16 onwards, teams will have **two** bans.
- Teams have 2 minutes to ban a map. Failure to ban a map within this time limit results in a lost ban.

### Warmups

- There will be no warmups during the qualifiers.
- From the group stage onwards, each team can choose to pick a warmup. Warmup maps must be a submitted beatmap, and have a drain time of 4 minutes or less.

### Picking

- Players have **2 minutes** to pick a map. Failure to pick a map within this time limit results in pick choice being passed to the opposing player.
- For Freemod picks, teams must have at least one person select any combination of the following mods: **Hidden, HardRock**
- **Failed scores WILL count**
- Tiebreakers are Freemod, however No Mod can be used.

Please enjoy game 🙏
