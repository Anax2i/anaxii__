Hi there. I understand your urge to want to contact me personally, but I ask that you first understand that this is **not** the place you want to ask me for help/support. I keep osu! support separate from personal messages, and also find that answering forum PMs is quite hard to keep up with. I therefore ask that you do one of the following options:
哈喽！我知道你很迫切地想要单独联系我，但我希望你明白这**不是**你找我寻求帮助和支持的地方。我一直把Osu!支持和个人消息分开，并且还发现很难一直坚持回答论坛小信。因此，我希望你能从下面几个选项中选一个：

## 技术支持

Most technical issues can be resolved by searching or posting in the [Tech Support forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/5). There are lots of others there to help you with your issues, so you will find a solution faster than contacting me.
大部分技术问题可以通过在[技术支持板块(英文)](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/5)发帖或搜索来解决。有许多人会在那里帮助你解决你的问题，所以比起找我，你可以在那里更快的找到解决方案。

## 一般的Osu!支持

For account issues, problems with payments, ban follow-ups, enquiries about tournaments and **anything related to needing help on osu!**, please send an email to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) (account queries) or [osu@ppy.sh](mailto:osu@ppy.sh) (anything else). If any of our support members are online, you can also use the little "?" button in the bottom-right-hand corner of the page you are viewing.

## Contacting peppy

If you wish to contact peppy personally for non-osu! related reasons, you can email him at [pe@ppy.sh](mailto:pe@ppy.sh). Please be aware that any support or account-related requests to this email will be marked as spam.
