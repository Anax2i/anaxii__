The following are toggles that can be added to .osu (and in some cases, .osb files) to affect [skinning](skinning "wikilink") / [storyboarding](storyboarding "wikilink"). Those that are added/removed by the [Beatmap Editor](Beatmap_Editor "wikilink") can also be included.

See also [skin.ini](skin.ini "wikilink").

`UseSkinSprites:Â 1`

Allows storyboards to refer to the player's current skin's sprites by their filenames. This is pointless if you're already forcing a skin (simply include the needed files) or have a map-specific skin in use. [Source](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?p=141760#p141760)
