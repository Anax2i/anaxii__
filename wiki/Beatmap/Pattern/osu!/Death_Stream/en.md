# Death Stream

**Death Streams** are a type of the [stream](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!/Stream) pattern. They occur in Expert difficulties and test the players ability to click in a steady rhythm for longer periods.

**Death Streams** tend to last longer than 30 [hit circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hit_circle).
