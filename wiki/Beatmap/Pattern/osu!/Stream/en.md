# Stream

A **stream** is an [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) [pattern](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern) where many [hit circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hit_circle) are placed close together and in quick succession. Streams usually represent high note density in a song and they are most commonly snapped to 1/4 ticks on the [timeline](/wiki/Client/Beatmap_editor/Timelines#hit-objects).

Streams are usually played with smooth movement, as opposed to the snappy movement of [jumps](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!/Jump). Most streams require the player to alternate clicking between both fingers due to their speed.

Streams last 5 or more [hit circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hit_circle), and can also start and end with [sliders](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Slider).

# Rapid stream / Triple

A **triple** is a shorter type of a [stream](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!/Stream) pattern. Its used to express smaller and more intense bursts of music in a song, and are often placed with small breaks in-between them, making them a challenge the players ability to control their clicks and aim at the same time.

# Death stream

A **death stream** is a type of [stream](/wiki/Beatmap/Pattern/osu!/Stream) pattern. They occur in [Expert](/wiki/Ranking_criteria/Difficulty_naming) difficulties and test the players ability to click to click rapidly in a steady rhythm for longer periods.  

**Death streams** tend to last longer than 30 [hit circles](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object/Hit_circle).
