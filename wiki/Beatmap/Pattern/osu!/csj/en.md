# Cross Screen Jumps

**Cross Screen Jumps** are a type of [Jump](/osu!/Jump) that occur when the jump distance between two [hit objects](/wiki/Gameplay/Hit_object) is big enough to go across most of the [playfield](/wiki/Client/Playfield).

Preferred to have over 350px in distance and less than 200ms in rythm spacing.
