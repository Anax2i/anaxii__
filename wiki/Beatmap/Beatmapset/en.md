# Beatmapset

<!-- TODO: connect to the rest of the wiki, ultimately this should replace the Glossary entry and be clearly distinguished from "beatmaps" -->

A **beatmapset** is a set of [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) for the same song. Beatmapsets show up on the [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) after [submission](/wiki/Glossary#bss) by their creators. They are displayed on the website and in-game as authored by a single user, called the [beatmapset host](Beatmapset_host), but in reality they may be made by a group of people (guests), that provide [guest difficulties](Guest_difficulty) or work in [collaboration](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_collaborations) with the host or each other.

The relation between a beatmap and its beatmapset, as well as their uniqueness, is tracked via [Beatmap ID](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_ID) and [Beatmapset_ID](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmapset_ID) fields of the corresponding [`.osu` file](/wiki/osu!_File_Formats/Osu_(file_format)). It helps creators update their beatmaps after [metadata changes](/wiki/Guides/Changing_the_Artist_or_Title), or if they happen to [change their username](/wiki/Help_Centre#name-changes).

Beatmapsets are sometimes referred to as *beatmaps*, but on osu! wiki *beatmap* usually means a single difficulty.
