Questions

I don't have/want to put it on osu!droid
----------------------------------------

-   Open the "Options Screen"
-   Scroll down and tap on "Select download folder"
-   Navigate to your preferred download place and confirm.
    -   If opsu!, go to `opsu/Songs` and set it there. It will automatically unzip the file.

Why are some functions missing?
-------------------------------

-   It a messy hack with the main focus on getting the beatmap download to work. Some of the extra stuff (such as the follow function and sort by popularity) might be broken from oversight in developer part.
