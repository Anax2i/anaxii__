Article Style Guide
===================

**Outdated**

This article aims to provide a comprehensive style guide for all osu!wiki articles to follow. Although Wikipedia already provides a more general [style guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style), a more specific one is necessary for *osu!* specific guidelines. As such, only guidelines pertaining to the osu!wiki and its basic formatting rules should be included here.

Notability
----------

Articles are only allowed in the main namespace if they fit the following criteria. Articles which do not fit the criteria may be deleted without notice.

### General  

1.  Articles must contain enough information to warrant a full page. If they do not have enough content, they should be merged with other similar articles.
2.  Articles must pertain directly to *osu!* in some way.
3.  Articles about people are only allowed if the person in question is a developer of *osu!* and/or either a part of or closely related to [osu!](/wiki/Glossary/en.md).
    1.  Notable people should be listed in the [List of Notable People](#) page.

4.  Features that are not currently in the game should avoid having their own article.
    1.  This excludes features which have been removed and April Fool's day features, which may be noted in articles affected by them.

### Community  

1.  Gameplay strategies, guides, how-tos, etc., should be subarticles of [Guides](/wiki/List-of-Guides/en.md).

### Wiki Rules  

1.  Parody, comedic, nonsense, hoax, and speculation articles, or any other article that could mislead players are not allowed to be created.
2.  Articles created for the purpose of advertising are not allowed.
3.  Articles about fan communities are not allowed due to advertising issues.

Articles in the "User:" namespace are exempt from the notability guidelines. They can be used for anything, provided they follow the other Wiki Rules.

### Redirects

Redirects are exempt from the normal notability, but must redirect to an article that fits the notability guidelines. If a redirect leads to another wiki. Redirects can be created if they fit one of the following:

1.  Alternate spelling of the title, such as "Combo color" for "Combo colour".
    1.  Incorrect spelling, typos, and irregular formatting are not allowed.

2.  Alternate or shortened name, provided the name is common usage, such as "CtB" for "[Catch the Beat](/wiki/Catch-the-Beat/en.md)".
3.  Previous article title.
    1.  An exception is if the previous title was not commonly used.

4.  Alternate capitalisation or form, including changing the title to plural case.
5.  A part of a merged or multi-topic article, such as a "Double Time" for [Game Modifiers](/wiki/Game-Modifiers/en.md).

Redirects in the user namespace may lead anywhere, except to an article that does not exist or another redirect.

Article titles
--------------

1.  Titles are to be written in sentence case. The first letter of a title must always be capitalised except in cases which are dully justified. Otherwise, words are to be capitalised only if they would be in running text.
    1.  As *osu!* should never be capitalised, it shouldn't be capitalised in the article title either. *e.g.* [osu!mania](/wiki/Osu!mania/en.md). As the wiki forces the capitalisation on the first letter of the title, use `{{DISPLAYTITLE:osu!mania}}` to alter manually the display title of the article.
        1.  Titles with a language namespace should be follow this format `{{DISPLAYTITLE:osu!mania` `(Language` `Name)}}`. For example, the [French osu!mania](/wiki/Osu!mania/fr.md) article should use `{{DISPLAYTITLE:osu!mania` `(Français)}}`

2.  Article titles should be in the singular form to maintain consistency. *e.g.* Beatmap and not Beatmaps.
3.  It is unnecessary to include an acronym or an abbreviation in addition to the name in a title. *e.g.* Double Time (DT).
4.  Definite and indefinite articles (the, a, and an) should not be placed at the beginning of titles unless they are part of a proper name.

Writing
-------

1.  As this wiki's purpose is to document facts, you should always avoid speculative and unsourced information. Generally speaking, information does not require sources if they can directly be seen in-game or are otherwise obvious. Other information however, such as information that is not widely known, must be sourced with a proper reference. Do *not* add content to an article if you cannot find a proper source.
    1.  This does not applies to guides and tutorials which do not document facts but are here to help the userbase get a better understanding of the game mechanics and are, therefore, subjective. This does not mean that the content of guides and tutorials should not be verified.

2.  Articles in the main namespace should always be written in the third-person perspective and without terms referential to the reader. Try not to use abbreviations of words either. For instance, sentences like "If you miss an object when playing a beatmap, you will break your combo.." should be written as "Failing to hit an object while playing a beatmap will break the current combo.".

### Keeping articles concise and up to date

Articles should only contain information that is up to date, *i.e.*, implemented in the latest version of the game. Anything that is outdated should be moved to the History section of the article. When something changes, note the change in the History section and remove the outdated information from other sections of the article. It is unnecessary to mention when a particular feature was implemented; this is once again reserved for the History section of the article.

### Grammar

Pages on the wiki should only use *British English* as a matter of consistency. For instance, “color” should be “colour”, “center” should be “centre”, “skillful” should be “skilful”, “paralleled” should be “parallelled”, and “analyze” should be “analyse”. It is recommended to get accustomed to British English and American English spelling differences before writing an article.

### Capitalisation

1.  The name of the game *osu!* should never be capitalised.
    1.  Words following the exclamation mark of *osu!*, if not divided by a blank space, should not be capitalised, *e.g.* osu!mania. If they are divided by a blank space, they must be capitalised if they are proper nouns, *e.g.* osu! Standard.

2.  In-game terms should be treated as common nouns and as such *should not* be capitalised. Proper nouns, however, such as the different game mode names (Standard, Taiko, Catch the Beat and Mania) or the mascots' names (Pippi, Yuzu, Maria) *should* always be capitalised.

#### Game modes  

The name of game modes should always be capitalised unless if it is following the exclamation mark without a blank space of the name *osu!*.

Example:


*osu!mania is a game mode that has been introduced years later the original game mode that is osu! Standard.*

<!-- -->

#### Game Modifiers  

Game modifiers as well as their abbreviations *should* always be capitalised.

Examples:


*In Taiko mode, Hard Rock increases Slider Velocity as well as Overall Difficulty.*

*Auto Pilot is not available for use in Taiko or Catch the Beat modes.*

<!-- -->

#### Difficulty Settings  

The different difficulty settings of a beatmap as well as their abbreviations *should* always be capitalised.

Example:


*Circle Size, known as "CS" in Edit's song selection, determines the size of circles and sliders*

<!-- -->

#### Gameplay Elements  

Gameplay elements should *never* be be capitalised.

Example:


*In osu! Standard, beatmaps are composed of three different gameplay elements: circles, sliders and spinners.*

### Section headings

An article should always begin with an introductory lead section, which should not contain section headings.

Article main sections should start with level 2 headers (two equal signs) and increase by one for subsections. *Never* use level 1 headers (one equal sign). Follow sentence style capitalisation, not title style, so only the first letter of the heading and proper nouns are capitalised.

There should be one space between sections as well as one space between the equal signs and the section name for ease of editing. If any "main article" links or thumb images are used, place them immediately under the section header, and then a space after those before the section content.

### Italics

1.  Any instance of "*osu!*" should be in italics unless it is included in the name of game modes or other services related to the game. *e.g.* osu! Standard or osu!direct.
    1.  Any other instance of the name of a videogame should also be in italics. *i.e. Elite Beat Agents*.

2.  Any emphasis (in talk pages, etc.) should be in italics instead of being in bold or uppercase letters. Use italics when introducing or distinguishing among terms.
    1.  The overuse of emphasis will reduce its effectiveness.

3.  Italics should be used for any occurence of foreign words including latin expressions and abbreviations like *e.g.* and *a priori*.

### Images

Images added to articles should fit the following guidelines:

-   Images should showcase an attribute of the articles topic.
    -   Images should not have the sole purpose of showcasing a bug, instead report the bug in the [Help subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/5).
    -   Images showcasing usage of specific features for decoration should be avoided.
-   When adding screenshots to an article, make sure the screenshots use the default skin. Screenshots that use custom skins or other custom content are not allowed.
    -   This does not apply to articles covering skinning.
    -   In the case of Taiko screenshots (Gameplay only), the Taiko skin can be used instead
-   Articles should only have one image showcasing an individual attribute of the articles content. For example, a slider in the beatmap editor.
-   Image captions should not have periods at the end, unless the phrase is a full sentence.
-   Images should showcase the most up to date version of *osu!* available for the content.
    -   Images that are outdated are subject to be removed.

### Linking

The use of links is a difficult balance between providing the reader enough useful links to allow them to "wander through" articles and excessive linking which can distract them from their reading flow.

Underlinking can cause the reader to become frustrated because questions may arise about the article's contents which can only be resolved by using the search option or other sources for clarification, interrupting and distracting the reader.

Overlinking may distract the reader because links are usually colored differently causing the eye to shift focus constantly. Additionally, if the same word is linked multiple times in the same paragraph it can cause the reader to question if the links are directing them to different articles or not.

The guidelines for linking are:

-   No more than 10 percent of the words in an article are contained in links.

<!-- -->

-   Unless it affects the sentence's wording and readability in a negative way, two links should not be next to each other in the text so that it looks like one link.

<!-- -->

-   Links for any single term should not be excessively repeated in the same article. Excessive linking is defined as multiple use of the same term, in a line or a paragraph, which will almost certainly appear needlessly on the viewer's screen. Remember, the purpose of links is to direct the reader to a new spot at the point(s) where the reader is most likely to take a temporary detour due to needing more information.

<!-- -->

-   Duplicating an important link distant from a previous occurrence in an article may well be appropriate. If an important term appears many times in a long article, but is only linked once at the very beginning of the article, it may actually be underlinked. Indeed, readers who jump directly to a subsection of interest must still be able to find a link. But take care in fixing such problems, the distance between duplicate links is an editor's preference, however if in doubt duplicate the term further down the article.

Linking to a redirect is preferred over using a piped link except in templates and other pages that will be transcluded. When a piped link is unavoidable, it should not point to a redirect. If a redirect can be avoided using a suffix on the link, that is preferred. E.g. Using `[[Beatmap]]s` instead of `[[Beatmaps]]` is desired.

### Date formatting

1.  To avoid having dates using different formats, dates should be written in "DD, Month, YYYY" format, *e.g.* "10 December 2011".
2.  Do not use superscripts or suffixes such as "23<sup>rd</sup> April" or "4th of May".
3.  If a numeric or terse date is needed (such as in a table), then use YYYY-MM-DD, always with 2 digits for month and day (*e.g.*, 2011-12-10 or 2012-05-04). Besides being the [ISO standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), dates in this format will naturally sort properly, say if the table column is later made sortable.
