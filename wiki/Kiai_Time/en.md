You can recognize a Kiai time because the screen flashes and you will see a [star](star_(skinning) "wikilink") fountain, afterwards all [Hit Objects](Hit_Objects "wikilink") will flash at the rhythm of the [main beat](bpm "wikilink") and stars will explode from the cursor when a [Hit Circle](Hit_Objects#Hit_Circle "wikilink") is hit or will fall from the cursor when you follow a [slider](slider "wikilink") or a [spinner](spinner "wikilink").

Kiai Time on Beatmapping
------------------------

The most common term for Kiai Time when [editing](Editor "wikilink") beatmaps is the "strongest part of the song" this is normally the chorus of the song, however some songs don't have a chorus, but they do have a strong part for you that feels cool, so you could insert Kiai Time in that section. Be advised however that spamming kiai start sections will cause a spam in kiai fountains. That is unrankable, and mostly hated by players because of the lag it may cause.

Things to take into consideration when using Kiai
-------------------------------------------------

1.  On **[Taiko](Taiko "wikilink") maps** Kiai sections give 20% more [score](score "wikilink"), so if you're mapping a Taiko specific [map](beatmap "wikilink"), take into consideration that Kiai does affect gameplay.
2.  **Be consistent**; it's annoying when you have 3 Kiai sections in different spots on the same [difficulty](difficulty "wikilink") and all of them sound different. Additionally, it's good that all difficulties from the same [mapper](mapper "wikilink") have the exact same Kiai times.
3.  **Do not use pure white [combo color](combo_colours "wikilink")** (255,255,255); it makes Kiai blinding and hurts the eyes.
4.  It's normal that a Kiai section is slightly more challenging than the rest of the mapset, as Kiai time is also the **strongest part of the map**.
5.  **[Guest difficulties](Guest_Difficulty "wikilink") may have different Kiai**. This is due to the fact that not everyone thinks the same spot is the "cool" spot of the beatmap; however Kiai should still be consistent.
6.  [Colorhaxing](Colorhaxing "wikilink") to make Kiai have a different set of [combo colours](combo_colours "wikilink") is a nice touch.
