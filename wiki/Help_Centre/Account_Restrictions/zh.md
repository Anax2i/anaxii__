# 账号限制

账号限制是指账号因不正常的状态、疑似或确定有违反条例等不良行为时被强行赋予限制的一段时间。
 
账号一旦受到限制，该账号就不能在社区内进行活动，直到限制解除。被限制的玩家依旧可以进行游戏、下载谱面和提交成绩，但是他们的个人资料无法被其他人看到。


下列功能无法在受限制期间使用：

- 游戏内聊天
- 私信玩家
- 在论坛或谱面评论内回复
- 上传或更新谱面
- 更新个人资料
- 购买商店的商品

## 我的账号受到了限制，我该怎么办？

如果你的账号受到了限制，不要惊慌，按照以下的步骤慢慢来：

- **等待 24 小时。** 有些受限状态是自动判断并赋予的。我们每天都会检查一遍所有新受限的账号，所以你大多数情况下只需要等待 24 小时，如果你的账号被误操作，24 小时后限制就会自动解除。
- **联系支持团队。** 如果你的账号在 24 小时后依旧处于限制状态，请**使用受限 osu! 账户绑定的邮箱**向 [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) 发送邮件来询问被限制的具体原因。请确保邮件内容包含受限制的 osu! 用户名，以及你认为自己账号已经受限的原因和详细证明。你的说明越详细，我们帮助你解决问题的难度就会越小。
- 如果你坚持认为你的账号是被误操作的，请立即联系我们协助你解除。

如果你的账号是因违反[社区规则](/wiki/rules)而受限，你的账号将会被强制执行三个月的冷却期，之后你才能向我们提出恢复申请。

如果你的原始账号（大号）没有处于受限状态，你就可以正常登录进行游戏，不过请确保在那之后不要再使用小号进行任何活动，因为这将会导致你受到更严厉的惩罚。

如果你的解除申请被我们通过，但在你登录游玩之后又被重新限制，别慌。我们的系统可能将你的账号错误地标记为受限，所以这种情况下 24 小时之内你的受限状态就会自动解除。当然你也可以立即向我们发送邮件来让我们更快地帮你恢复到正常状态！


## 为什么我的账号受到了限制？

你的账号处于受限状态，可能是由以下几个原因造成的：

- **这并不是你的第一个账号。** 开小号的行为违反了社区规则。一个玩家的所有小号都会被永久封禁，但是大多数情况下大号将会持续开放，玩家依旧可以使用大号进行游玩。如果开小号的行为非常严重，甚至造成了滥用，那么相应的大号将会被禁言一段时间以示警告，并且如果开小号的行为一直在进行，那么相应的主号也会被受限。
  - 如果你的账号处于受限状态，并且你拥有其他的 osu! 账号，那么请不要再使用你的小号进行任何活动，请一直使用你的主号正常进行游戏。如果你不能使用你的主号，请发邮件给 [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) 来让我们帮助你让它恢复正常。
- **你将你的账号分享给了他人进行游戏。** 一号多用也是违反社区规则的。如果你让其他人使用你的账号进行游戏，那么这个账号将被受限，并且他们自己的账号也同时可能会被禁言或者被受限。如果这种情况意外发生，请立即发邮件给 [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) 好让我们知悉并协助解决。
- **你作弊了。** 使用第三方的程序、外挂，或者进行其他任何形式的不公平操作都会被立即封禁。
- **其他情况。** 账号服务团队保留因不在这三项之内的原因而限制账号的权利。

如果我们完全确定限制账号的操作是正确的，那么我们会要求玩家等待一段时间才能向我们提出解除申请。这段时间通常被称为*冷却期*，并且冷却期的长短取决于受限之原因。

## 在我能够提出恢复申请之前的冷却期内我能做什么？

- **继续享受戳饼的快乐！** 尽管你的账号处于受限状态，尚且还在冷却期内，但是你依旧可以享受游戏，只要你使用的是你的主号（如果你有小号的话）。你账号受限时所创造的成绩会被上传，除非限制解除之后你的账号回到了先前的状态，否则受限期间的成绩都将会保留！
- **保持良好的作风。** 
- **Keep enjoying the game!** While your account is restricted and you are on cooldown, you are more than welcome to continue playing the game (as long as you play on your original account!). The scores you achieve while restricted will be submitted, and unless your account is rolled back, they will remain after you become unrestricted.
- **Maintain good behaviour.** We understand that being restricted can be frustrating, but think of it as a chance to take some time off, away from the community. Try to avoid interacting with the community for at least a few days (whether it be via Discord, social media, or other forms of contact) to cool down and reflect on the actions that may have contributed to your account being restricted.
- **Make sure you respect the rules.** Long-term restrictions are punishments for breaking the rules. If you continue to do so while restricted, the cooldown before you can appeal will be reset to three months from your last offence. This includes, for example, continuing to cheat, accessing others' accounts, or creating new accounts to evade a restriction.
- **Follow the support team's instructions.** The three-month cooldown is a chance to take time off and reflect on your actions. If you attempt submitting an appeal before the cooldown period is over, your emails will be ignored. If you are unsure when your cooldown expires, when you will be allowed to appeal, or which of your accounts you should be playing on (and appealing from), you are welcome to send us an email to ask.
- **Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.** As long as you are not trying to circumvent punishment, we will happily answer any questions you have about your account's restriction!

## My cooldown has passed. How do I appeal?

You can appeal by sending an email to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) including the username of your account. Make sure you are sending the appeal from the email address associated with your account. After you send your appeal, expect a reply within one week. If you have not received one by then, please contact us on twitter or by email - there is a chance we may not have received it.

When appealing, we expect the following points to be covered:

- **Account history.** It does not need to be too detailed. This should include all your breaches of the major rules (multi-accounting, account sharing, cheating, or major silences). You do not need to remember every date, every silence, or every account you created, as long as you are honest with what you did. This includes any rules you have broken while restricted, if applicable.
- **Why you broke the rules.** An explanation as to what led you to decide to create new accounts, give your account away, cheat, etc. will help us (and you) determine whether or not you are at risk of offending again. If you continued offending while restricted, we are also interested in knowing why.
- **How you obtained the means to do so.** This applies mostly to cheating - we want to know where you obtained the tool you used, how you came across it, and whether or not it is still present on your computer.
- **Why we should allow you back.** Most of the time, this ties in to the second point. We just want to ensure that you will not be breaking the rules again! Please understand that the more rule violations in your account's history, the more we will expect in this section of the appeal.

## What if my appeal is granted?

If we decide to let you return, we will require that you agree to some terms before unrestricting your account.

- **You will not offend again.** This includes cheating and account sharing.
- **You will not create another account, be it for yourself or someone else.**
- **You should not associate with other accounts** including playing on shared computers.
- **Any major misbehaviour will result in immediate restriction**. This includes major silences.

Additionally, for a period of one year, we will not grant any flag changes for your account.

In some cases, an appeal returnee may be banned from official and badged tournaments, both as a competitor and member of the tournament's team. The duration of this ban is 1 year per offence (if a user is on their second appeal, the ban lasts 2 years). The unrestriction email will clarify the duration of this ban.

**Cheating or account sharing during an official or badged tournament will lead to the user's permanent ban from any future ones.** This ban cannot be appealed (your email will be ignored if you attempt to) and will not be removed, reduced, or waived under any circumstances.

Some players may become restricted again once they start playing after having their appeal granted. This is an automated process and will generally be removed within 24 hours. Don't hesitate to ask questions on twitter at [@osusupport](https://twitter.com/osusupport) or by sending an email to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) if this happens to you!

Some offences will lead to your account being rolled back upon unrestriction. They are meant to delete illegitimate scores that were submitted on your account **across all modes**, as well as unlocked medals and profile badges. **Playcount and playtime will not be modified.**

## My appeal has been denied!

There are several reasons why an appeal might be denied.

- **It was sent too early.** If the cooldown for your account has not yet passed, your appeal will be denied. If you are unsure when you can actually appeal, please reply to our answer - we will give you the correct date.
- **Your appeal was insufficient or incomplete.** If your appeal does not sufficiently cover the four points listed above, we will request that you write a more complete one. This **does not** necessarily reset the cooldown for your account and you are free to send your new appeal at any point in time! However. if you attempted lying or hiding major rule violations you committed (mainly multi-accounting or cheating), your appeal will be denied for being non-truthful, and your cooldown will be reset to three months. This is another chance for you to reflect on your actions and make sure you did not forget anything.
- **You have been evading or playing on other accounts.** Creating another account to be able to play online while your account is restricted is considered an attempt at evading the restriction and will reset your cooldown to three months from the date you created the account. If you attempt evading too many times, your appeal might be permanently denied. If you are still accessing or playing on your multi-accounts while restricted, your cooldown will also be reset. Remember that multi-accounting is against the [rules](/wiki/rules) and you are expected to only play on your original account. If you are unsure which account counts as your original account, send us an email and we will let you know!
- **You continued offending while restricted.** There is no reason to unrestrict someone who continues to break the rules even after having been restricted. If you do continue offending, the cooldown for your account will be reset to your last offence. In the case of extreme or continuous offences, your appeal might be permanently denied.
- **Your history is too severe.** In cases of extreme offenders, or players who get restricted again after they have already been unrestricted on a successful appeal, we might simply state that your history is too severe to rejoin the game at the current time. Should this apply to you, we recommend waiting **a long time** before appealing again, and making sure you do not break any further rules in that time.
