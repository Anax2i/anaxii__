-   Pick out your songs folders. Copy-Paste to Desktop or any directory you prefer.
    -   You can opt to remove StoryBoard elements, .osb file , Skin, video , (Taiko/CtB/Mania) difficulties to trip down the overall size. Do not do this on original version.
-   Compress the folders with preferred file compression software.
