Questions
=========

I added a new beatmap and T-Aiko! didn't load it
------------------------------------------------

-   You did not hit the refresh button at the upper-left of the "Select a Song".
-   You placed the beatmap at the wrong beatmap directory or you set a wrong beatmap directory. Set the beatmap directory properly \[See below\] and replace your beatmap to a proper beatmap directory.
    -   Downloads from [osu!MapDownloader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myapp.downloader) cannot be played by T-Aiko.

I have a lot of beatmaps at osu!droid/Songs...
----------------------------------------------

-   From Main Menu, press Options-&gt; Advanced Options-&gt; Beatmap Folder.
-   Modify "mnt/sdcard/T-Aiko!/Songs" to "mnt/sdcard/osu!droid/Songs".
-   Return to Main Menu.
    -   T-Aiko! may stop abruptly to follow the new filepath and the application may shut down itself.
-   Press T-Aiko application and go to Play menu (Song selection). Your beatmaps should appear.
    -   If your new beatmaps did not appear, press the refresh button located at the upper-left screen. It will recompile the beatmaps library.
