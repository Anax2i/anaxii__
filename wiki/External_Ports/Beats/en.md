Questions
=========

Why is osu! mod here is under-developed?
----------------------------------------

-   Pesets's osu!droid does the job already. There is no reason for the developer to continue when there is a port for osu! that does better.

Can it play osu!mania songs?
----------------------------

-   No. It can only play:-
    -   StepMania 3.9 ".sm" format
    -   Dance With Intensity v2.50.00 ".dwi" format
    -   osu! ".osu" format.

Trivia
------

<img src="Beats_broken.jpg" title="Example" alt="Example" width="200" />

-   Autoplay can completely ignore the rule and always get Marvelous and OK even when the hitcircles stray to the invisible end of the playfield
