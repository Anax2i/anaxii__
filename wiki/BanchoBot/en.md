BanchoBot is a bot (i.e. a set of commands with automated responses) programmed by **Echo49** that assists people in chat by displaying certain information and announcing game-related messages.
BanchoBot is your host for the [osu!chat server](/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) and has a profile named _[BanchoBot](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3)_.

## Using BanchoBot

To use BanchoBot, type `/help` into chat; any chat tab will do. After that, you will be given a list of available commands in your chat bar that only you can see. **All commands are case insensitive.** Below is a list of all of the commands and their effects: 

## Commands

**Note: You *must* prefix all commands with a `/`!** All effect listings are verbatim from the command list. Notes are shown in *italics*.

### Standard Commands

*For a table of standard commands, go to the [Chat Console](/wiki/Chat_Console) article.*

### /bb Commands

Inside of the BanchoBot tab, the prefix `/bb` is not required. All commands beginning with `/bb` open a new tab with BanchoBot if the tab is not already opened; otherwise they appear in BanchoBot's tab as if you typed them in there. All responses are received through BanchoBot's tab.
