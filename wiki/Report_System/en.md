What is the report system?
--------------------------

The report system is an important feature to inform the moderators about misbehaving user(s) and for them to take action.

It is not only limited to in game chat but also in other places such as the forum and wiki itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to report someone?
----------------------

You may report at many places, but let's start at the chat.

### Using the !report command

`Format: !report `<username>` `<reason>

Take note that <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> are not necessary.

If the user has a space at their username, replace it with an underscore ('\_') because our chat is based on [IRC](IRC "wikilink").

`User: This User`
`Example: This_User is spamming in #channel`

Reports are not case-sensitive so it's okay to use lowercase letters like **this\_user**.

### Using the report button ingame

`Report the user by this way only needs a type of reason and your custom text, unlike the !report command.`

</center>
### Using the report button at the user's profile

This also works the same as the report button ingame.

Remember to add details to your report (like translations) at the comments.

</center>
### Using the report link at the user's record at beatmap listing

Only use this when you are reporting users for cheating.

Examples what to report
-----------------------

:\* **Spamming or flooding in chat.**

Using a broken keyboard is not an excuse!

:\* **Excessive use of uppercase letters.**

This has been considered as shouting and annoying.

:\* **Posting of inappropriate contents such as pornographic materials (questionable/suggestive are considerable).**

Moderators immediately silence for this, removing the content without warning.''

:\* **Posting of unwanted contents such as advertisements, screamers and referrals.**

Take note that spamming streaming links are applied to this rule.

:\* **Offensive behavior towards other players.**

Telling people to kill themselves is not a good thing to say.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Can other players see my reports in chat?**

Obviously, no, unless you typed the command prefix wrong. Make sure you type an exclamation mark first!

<!-- -->

**I accidentally reported a user! Will I get an infringement?**

No. Don't worry about it, we can ignore false reports unless abused.

<!-- -->

**Can I report multiple times?**

Reporting once is enough but you can report several times during the day. Two or three times should be fine.

You can either report the channel saying that multiple players are causing problems, or just list of each person.

<!-- -->

**Does this include private messages?**

Most issues on private messages such as insults are not handled.

A user can use the ignore system to avoid any messages getting received from the ignored user including channels.

*Note: Ignore list will reset during you close the game client.*

<!-- -->

**Can I report a moderator?**

You can, but it is recommended to contact the osu! support (support@ppy.sh) for staff complaints.
