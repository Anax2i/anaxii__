So osu!forums has this subforum as many know as **[Beatmap Projects](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/53)**. It might seem intimidating at first but here are the tips and tricks on [How to not Embarrass Yourself in the Projects Subforum](How_to_not_Embarrass_Yourself_in_the_Projects_Subforum "wikilink").

Do not request songs
--------------------

[*IMPORTANT: DO NOT POST BEATMAP SONGS REQUESTS HERE* by: LuigiHann](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/23976/)

This forum is here for fun, community-driven collaborative projects built around albums or artists. If you look at most of the threads in here, you should get a sense of how it works.

This forum is not for posting some random song that you want somebody to map because you like it but are too lazy or incompetent to map it yourself. Threads requesting one specific song (or several completely unrelated songs) will be locked and moved to the Wasteland.

Thanks.
