# Skinning

![osu!tourney can be customized in various ways](Osutourneycustom.png "osu!tourney can be customized in various ways")

osu!tourney supports various modifications you can apply to design the client suitable for your tournament.
For that, you need to create a `Skin` folder into your fresh osu! install you intend to use as osu!tourney.

The path of the folder must be `/osu!/Skins/User/tournament`.
The skin elements can be placed in this folder and support `.jpg` and `.png` file extensions.
To skin them properly, name your elements accordingly:

- `background` - this is the background sprite used by osu!tourney during the entire time. The default background for osu!tourney can be found [here](https://s.ppy.sh/images/tournament/default.png).
- `background-win1` (optional) - the background sprite will be fade over to this sprite in Results Screen when the left team won.
   It will fade back to `background` when leaving Results Screen.
   If this element is not placed, it will stay on `background`.
- `background-win2` (optional) - the background sprite will be fade over to this sprite in Results Screen when the right team won.
   It will fade back to `background` when leaving Results Screen.
   If this element is not placed, it will stay on `background`.
- `tourney-title` (optional) - this image will be placed placed on top of your background sprites and will be located at the bottom of your osu!tourney screen.
   This can be used to put a static image, e.g. a logo of your tournament.

![osu!tourney with team icons. The left icon is named Team 1.png and the right icon is named Team 2.png](Osutourneyicons.png "osu!tourney with team icons. The left icon is named Team 1.png and the right icon is named Team 2.png")

It is possible to create team icons (e.g. country flags or user avatars) in the skin folder.
These icons must be placed at the path `/osu!/Skins/User/tournament/icons`.

All icons must be named exactly like the Team name.
If your match is called `Test Tourney: (Team 1) vs (Team 2)`, your icons must be called `Team 1 and Team 2`.
Icons can be in `.jpg` or `.png` format and have an optimal resolution of `50x50px`.
