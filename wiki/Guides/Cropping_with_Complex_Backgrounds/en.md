# How to crop images with complex backgrounds

## Step \#1

First, you have to choose an image. We are going to present it to you in this image that you can see. We will show you how to do this using GIMP. (For this method, we need a free selection tool, the Lasso).

## Step \#2

Now, select any point you want to start selecting your character. It's not that hard, simply place nodes along with your character outline. The closer placing of notes - the more precise your cut will be.

## Step \#3

Now, continue until you select outline of your character completely. Ignore for now any background hair.

## Step \#4

If you have finished your main selection, now we can take care of any background that was selected together with our character. Continue using yor lasso tool, but change its mode to "Subtract from current selection" aka removing selection. And now do the same way as at beginning at deselect any background that was between hair, legs etc.

## Step \#5

Only one thing left to do, cut our character out of the picture and paste it to new one or invert your selection (CTRL + I) and delete background.

## Finish

It's done. It doesn't look very good, especially the ends of the hair, but that's only because we weren't very precise in doing it.

It can take a little time, but final effect is really good.
