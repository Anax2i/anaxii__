# How to Get Your Map Ranked

*See also: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

Having trouble getting your [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) ranked? You've come to the right place.

## Step 1: Modding

***Precursor: [Getting Your Map Modded](/wiki/Guides/Getting_Your_Map_Modded)***

The first step towards getting your map ranked is to get people looking at it. People willing to [mod](/wiki/Modding) your map can be found in the `#modreqs` channel, the [modding forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60), or by asking them directly after checking their signature for modding policies. Remember that all mods are useful; any perspective on your map can be used to make it a better one. Consider every suggestion a modder makes, and if you turn any down, post a detailed response in the map thread making it clear why. It makes them a better modder and makes you think about how your map can improve! If you found the mod useful, give the post an upvote.

## Step 2: Getting your beatmap nominated

Once your beaatmap has a decent amount of mods and approval, and you think it is ready to be ranked, you can get a [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominator). Check the team member's signature or userpage to see if they have a modding policy. If they are open to requests, ask them politely in-game if they would not mind taking a look at your map. Many of Beatmap Nominators are busy as there are an awful lot of pending maps to get through, so do not be too disheartened if you are turned down; however, having lots of mods and approval on your beatmap will help encourage Beatmap Nominators to look at your beatmap.

## Step 3: Nominations

Just because your beatmap got nominated does not mean you can sit back and relax! Do not ignore mods from normal users on your beatmap. Although only a Beatmap Nominator or Nomination Assessment Team member can rank your map, anyone can improve it. A more thoroughly modded beatmap means an easier job for the Beatmap Nominator who looks at it. Once you have applied a mod on your nomination, the Beatmap Nominator who originally gave the nomination will be happy to come back and reinstate the nomination. Keep in mind that you will also have an easier time getting your nomination noticed by Beatmap Nominators if it is high priority. Having people build your hype train to push it up the priority list should make the wait for getting ranked shorter.
