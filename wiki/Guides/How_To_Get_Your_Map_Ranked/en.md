# How to Get Your Map Ranked

*See also: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

Having trouble getting your [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) ranked? You've come to the right place.

## Step 1: Modding

***Precursor: [Getting Your Map Modded](/wiki/Modding_Guides/Getting_Your_Map_Modded)***

The first and most important step towards getting your map ranked is to get people looking at it. People willing to [mod](/wiki/Modding) your map can be found in the #modreqs channel of chat, the [modding forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60), or by asking them directly after checking their signature for modding policies. Remember that all mods are useful; any perspective on your map can be used to make it a better one. Consider every suggestion a modder makes, and if you turn any down, post a detailed response in the map thread making it clear why. It makes them a better modder and makes you think about how your map can improve! Also, if you found the mod particularly useful, be sure to give the post an upvote.

If a modder likes your map, they might give it hype. Hype allows your mod to get noticed more by Beatmap Nominators. Your map's hype train is important when it comes to moving on to the next step.

## Step 2: Getting your beatmap nominated

Once your map has been pending for a while, has 5 people on your hype train, and you think it's perfect and ready to be ranked, it's time to get a [Beatmap Nominator](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nomination_Group). Make sure you check the team member's signature or userpage to see whether they have a modding policy; if they're open to requests or there's nothing there, ask them politely in game if they wouldn't mind taking a look at your map. Lots of Beatmap Nominators are extremely busy â€” there are an awful lot of pending maps to get through, so don't be too disheartened if you are turned down. Having plenty of mods and hype on your map will help encourage Beatmap Nominators to look at your map, so if you're having difficulties getting a Beatmap Nominator to look at your map, remember that your hype train and mods will help you out.

## Step 3: Bubbles

Just because your map is bubbled doesn't mean your work is done! Don't ignore mods by normal users on your bubbled map. Although only a Beatmap Nominator or Quality Assurance Team member can rank your map, anyone can help improve it. A more thoroughly modded map means an easier job for the Beatmap Nominator who looks at it. Once you have applied a mod on your bubble, the Beatmap Nominator who originally gave the bubble will always be happy to come back and reinstate it. Keep in mind that you'll also have an easier time getting your bubble noticed by Beatmap Nominators if it's high priority. Having people build your hype train to push it up the list should make the wait for getting ranked shorter.
