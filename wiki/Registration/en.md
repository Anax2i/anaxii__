3. Sign in to osu! and the process is finished. You have successfully registered an osu! account!

## Signing In to osu!

### osu! executable

![osu! executable](Register-3.png "osu! executable")  

This executable (which should be named `osu!.exe`) will open the game itself. If updates are required, they will be applied automatically. _Note: You do not need to open osu! as an administrator. If the game requires it, it will prompt for it itself._

### Options panel

*See also: [Options](/wiki/Options)*

If this is your first time starting osu!, you will see this on the left side of your game's screen. Enter your username and password to their respective fields and sign in.

### User panel

Once you have entered your username and password correctly, you will see your user panel at the top left of your screen. You are now signed into osu! and ready to play! You will also see your user panel on the bottom of your song selection screen, to the right of your ``Selection Options`` button.
