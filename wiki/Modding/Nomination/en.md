# Nomination

**Nomination** is a formal vote of approval coming from [beatmap nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) (BN) or members of the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team) (NAT), which indicates a beatmap's readiness to become [ranked](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#ranked). It is given to completed beatmaps of sufficient quality that follow the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and have 5 or more [hypes](/wiki/Beatmap/Hype).

Beatmaps that receive two nominations per each available [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) are moved to the [beatmap ranking queue](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure/Ranking_queue), where they stay for at least 7 days for further inspection. If no critical issues are found, beatmaps are then moved to the Ranked category and receive their own [leaderboards](/wiki/Ranking).

Nominations may be removed from a map in one of the following cases:

- A beatmap is updated by its [host](/wiki/Beatmap/Beatmap_host).
- Serious or unrankable issues found by a BN or a member of the NAT.

## History

Nominations in their present form were implemented as part of the [beatmap discussion](/wiki/Beatmap_discussion) system.

Previously, in the era of [forum modding](/wiki/Modding/Forum_modding), nominations were expressed through a combination of ![Bubble icon](/wiki/shared/icon/bubble.gif) [bubble](/wiki/Modding/Bubble) and ![Heart icon](/wiki/shared/icon/heart.gif) rank posts, where bubble icon meant the first nomination, and the heart icon was the second. Maps going for [approval](/wiki/Beatmap/Category#approved) instead of rank needed to abide by a slightly different set of rules and required three nominations, with the last of them having ![Flame icon](/wiki/shared/icon/flame.gif) flame icon.
