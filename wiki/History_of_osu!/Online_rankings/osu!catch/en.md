# osu!catch rankings history

The following is a list of players who are recognised to have reached rank #1 in the [global ranking](https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/fruits/performance) of [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch).

Over the years, there were three different systems used for ranking players:

- [Ranked Score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score/Ranked_score) (6 October 2007 – 24 July 2012)
- [ppv1](/wiki/Performance_points/ppv1) (24 July 2012 – 27 January 2014)
- [ppv2](/wiki/Performance_points) (27 January 2014 – present)

Because of this, this list only includes players who have reached rank #1 on the main leaderboard that was used at the time. *Italicised* dates and numbers indicate that the corresponding player is continuing their reign as the osu!'s rank #1 holder either from the previous year or into the following year.
