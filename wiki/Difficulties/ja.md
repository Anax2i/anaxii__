------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines for osu! Standard Game Mode
======================================

Some of the accepted and established general attributes of osu! standard difficulties. There have been guidelines for years and they have been consistent for the lower difficulties. This should cover most of the ideas that are the "norm" but it is not complete and exceptions can be made if necessary.

Easy
----

Generally following the baseline and the most distinctive features of a song. Leave plenty of **recovery time**, especially after spinners, and use sliders to avoid monotonous 1/1 spam. Following the vocals or melody is a possibility. **Consistent spacing is required** to teach beginners the correlation between timing and distance. Overall you want to achieve the highest possible readability while keeping the balance between too boring and too complex beat patterns.

Difficulty setup should include a **low slider velocity, generous drain rate, low to medium hit accuracy, and a bigger circle size compared to the higher difficulties**. Approach rate should be set to match the BPM and slider velocity of the map and allow enough time to plan the next move without cluttering the screen with too many hit objects.

-   Avoid stacked notes
-   Avoid overlapping notes
-   Avoid kick sliders

Normal
------

Generally following the most distinctive features of a song. **Recovery times** should be plenty but can be less than in the related Easy map. **Use of 1/2 notes** is encouraged as well as the developement of more **interesting beat placements** if the song allows it. **Spacing should be mostly consistent** to teach beginners the correlation between timing and distance.

Difficulty setup should use a **low to medium slider velocity, medium drain rate, medium hit accuracy, and a big circle size that is the same or smaller than in the related [Easy] map**. Approach rate should match the higher slider velocity and pacing of the map while leaving enough reaction and planning time without cluttering the screen.

-   Avoid triplets/streams (1/4 notes)
-   Avoid spacing inconsistencies

Hard
----

Following mostly "what you can hear". Try to capture the essence of the song and don't leave out too much. **Interesting patterns and beat placements are encouraged** along with jumps and short streams/triplets. **If your mapset features a Normal and an Insane make sure your Hard map is a reasonable stepping stone between them**.

Difficulty setup should include a BPM appropriate slider velocity that captures the pacing of the song. Use multiple slider velocities if needed. Drain rate and hit accuracy should balance the difficulty of your patterns and the frequency of streams and other 1/4 notes. Approach rate should be balanced between the BPM related note density and the readability of more complex patterns.

-   Avoid extremely long streams
-   Avoid full screen jump patterns

Insane & Expert
---------------

Changes and new trends in mapping will steadily evolve the Insane and Extra tiers of beatmapping. Some gameplay elements or difficulty levels that used to be "unrankable" are more common today. Mappers are constantly experimenting and pushing the limits of the Ranking Criteria as well as the skill levels of the players.

Example Spreads
---------------

From the [Ranking Criteria](http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Ranking_criteria):

-   **The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars.**

<!-- -->

-   Consecutive order means this is the expected full spread ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-s.png "Easy") ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-s.png "Normal") ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard") ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane") ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert")
-   Depending on the star rating gap several combinations of lower difficulties are theoretically allowed:
    -   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-s.png "Easy")(1.4) ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard")(2.5) ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard")(3.6)
    -   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-s.png "Easy")(1.4) ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard")(2.6) ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane")(3.8)

<!-- -->

-   It is generally allowed to skip the **[Easy]** difficulty if the **[Normal]** difficulty follows the general guidelines of an Easy map
    -   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-s.png "Normal") ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard") ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane") ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert")

<!-- -->

-   It is **NOT** allowed to skip a huge difficulty range like **[Hard]** or **[Insane]**
    -   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-s.png "Easy") ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane") ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane") ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert")
    -   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-s.png "Normal") ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane") ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane") ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert")
    -   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-s.png "Normal") ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard") ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert") ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert")

<!-- -->

-   Depending on the prevalent gameplay elements in your **[Insane]** and **[Expert]** you could be asked to include another lower or higher rated additional **[Insane]**
    -   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-s.png "Normal")(1.9) ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard")(3.2) ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane")(5.1) ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert")(5.9) needs the addition of something like ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-s.png "Normal")(1.9) ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard")(3.2) ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane")**(4.3)** ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane")(5.1) ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert")(5.9)

A good difficulty spread is **more than just Star Rating and Web Icons**! However, the icons help players to get a quick overview and if possible you should always aim to use them appropriately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines for Taiko Game Mode
==============================

Some of the accepted and established general attributes of Taiko difficulties which have previously found their roots in Taiko no Tatsujin(太鼓の達人). There have been guidelines for years and they have been consistent for the lower difficulties. This should cover most of the ideas that are the "norm" but it is not complete and exceptions can be made if necessary. For a more in depth going guide, follow these links:

-   [Mapping Taiko Difficulties](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Mapping_Taiko_Difficulties) ([original thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/152263))
-   [Taiko Mapping Basics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STnZVwB-RN6glJbSlOiTEiUxu7XmgMInXrG15s2pfbQ/edit)

Kantan
------

Easiest difficulty in a mapset which follows the most distinctive **beat** of a song. Try having in a **consistent way** a sufficient amount of rest moments, especially when patterns become more alternative and complicated. Monotonically patterns though are not always in the need of rest moments because of their easy appereance. Spinners should be only used on long sounds to teach beginner how to play these while sliders can be put on shorter sounds.

Difficulty setup should include a **really high drain rate** and **low hit accuracy**(OD: 3~4). The **slider velocity is 1.4** but should be lowered on really high BPMs to allow beginner having enough time to plan the next move without cluttering the screen with too many hit objects.

-   Avoid short spinners
-   Avoid slider velocity changes
-   Avoid odd patterns
-   Avoid too long constellations with hard patterns

Futsuu
------

One of the easier difficulties which generally follows the most distinctive **features** of a song. Use of 1/2 notes is encouraged as well if the song allows it, but as harder patterns become, the more **rest moments** should be used. **Beat placement should be mostly consistent** to teach beginners the correlation between timing and distance. Spinners can be shorter, but should have plenty of breaks to the upcoming note.

Difficulty setup should include a **high up to really high drain rate** and *low / medium hit accuracy*(OD: 4~5). The **slider velocity is 1.4** but should be lowered on really high BPMs to allow beginner having enough time to plan the next move without cluttering the screen with too many hit objects.

-   Avoid too short spinners
-   Avoid slider velocity changes
-   Avoid too long pattern constellations, especially on 1/2 snapping

Muzukashii
----------

This difficulty carries the properties from Kantan and Futsuu in a larger amount and follows the **song itself** in a closer way. Patterns can become longer and spacings more infrequent. While this difficulty works as a bridge to the harder difficulty bracket of Oni, it is still important to have a **good portion of rest moments**, especially when patterns become harder due to possible use of shorter 1/4 or 1/3.

Difficulty setup should include a **high drain rate** and *medium / high hit accuracy*(OD: 5~6).

-   Use of little slider velocity changes are possible
-   Use 1/4 sparingly
-   Avoid complicated 1/4 patterns
-   Avoid too long pattern constellations, especially when 1/4 patterns are bounded together with 1/2

Oni
---

Normaly refered as hardest difficulty in a mapset which follows the **essence of a song**. Harder, longer and more complicated pattern structures are encouraged. The use of 1/4, 1/3 and 1/6 patterns becomes more significant in this difficulty. **If your mapset features a Muzukashii and an Inner / Ura make sure your Oni map is a reasonable stepping stone between them.**

Difficulty setup should include a **medium / high drain rate** and *high hit accuracy*(OD: 6~7).

-   Avoid gimmicks
-   Avoid clustered patterns
-   Avoid overlaps
-   Avoid 1/4 finishers if song doesn't call for it

Inner Oni / Ura Oni
-------------------

These difficulties are **equal to Oni**, yet, are considered as extra Oni and refered as the **hardest difficulties in a mapset** since they often follow **everything the song provides**. Changes and new trends in mapping will steadily evolve the Inner Oni and Ura Oni tiers of beatmapping. Some gameplay elements or difficulty levels that used to be "unrankable" are more common today. Mappers are constantly experimenting and pushing the limits of the Ranking Criteria as well as the skill levels of the players.

Example Taiko Spreads
---------------------

From the [Ranking Criteria](http://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/Ranking_criteria):

-   **The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order.** Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars.
-   '''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko difficulty. ''' If you decide to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty.

A common set contains the following four difficulties: Kantan, Futsuu, Muzukashii and Oni which difficulty spread between them **should be approximately kept the same**. To achieve this, it is highly recommended to set a **main snapping** for each difficulty which **follows the pace of the song**. If the spread still happens to be uneven, you may move to another type of set which contains an additional Inner Oni and sometimes even an Ura Oni. These difficulties can be used as filler in a mapset to ensure a consistent spread in case four difficulties are not enough. Also in this way, an **Oni can be mapped easier for people who are still not familiar with harder difficulties, while Inner/Ura serves as harder Oni**.

-   Common set: ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy")![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal")![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard")![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane")

Make sure that your every single difficulty **fits to the overall spread**.

To have an idea of how these sets can be build up, examples will be given:

**Example 1:** Having a main snapping through all difficulty which patterns vary depending on the pace of the song.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4

**Example 2:** Same snapping case but with the difference of having at certain places denser patterns. Good for songs which support harder mapsets.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with some 1/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1 with some 1/2
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with some 1/4
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4 with harder 1/4 or 1/6

**Example 3:** Sometimes the snapping behaviour can shift threw the diffs, depending on the songs BPM. In this case the difficulties have lower density due to a slow BPM song and does not requier a Kantan since Futsuu is sufficient enough. It should be noted that the controvers case is possible, but it rather leans to a behaviour of **example 2**.

-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2

**Example 4 what should not happen:** Difference between Oni and Muzukashii is too big which makes the entry from one to the other diff really hard, while Muzukashii to Futsuu is denser and makes the spread inconsistent.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + **easy 1/2**
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + **demanding 1/4**

**Example 5 what should not happen:** While the transition from Kantan to Futsuu and Muzukashii to Oni is fine, Futsuu to Muzukashii spread happens to be bigger since Futsuu doesn't have any 1/2 for a better transition into Muzukashii and hence, the spread is uneven and splitted in lower and higher difficulties. Example 2 should be followed to fix such problems.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with 1/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with 1/4
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4

While Inner and Ura Oni are normaly in use for hard Onis, they can also be used for **fixing spread problems**. For example, if a spread happens to become too large between two difficulties, you can either try refining the existing difficulties to fit the spread or add a **new map** if the gap between two difficulties is too large to be refined. **Example 6:** This would be a common set with additional Inner / Ura Oni a song can carry.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4
-   ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-t.png "Expert") Main snapping 1/2 + demanding 1/4

**Example 7:** Such sets are also possible; having in general a common set with an additional really hard Oni for high tier players.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + easy 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + easy 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + easy 1/2
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + easy 1/4
-   ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-t.png "Expert") Main snapping 1/2 + demanding 1/4

Rest moments in Taiko
---------------------

**Rest moments** or **breaks** are really important in a Taiko beatmap and can be seen as the *hidden extra note*. They have a great influence when it's about the **difficulty** and **spread** of a mapset and can **emphasize certain places** in a map. Beside following the song, the lenght of a rest moment depends also of the **main snapping** in a map. So if for example a Muzukashii has a main snapping of 2/1 + 1/1, the breaks should be bigger than this snapping to **avoid continuous mapping**. Sometimes the lenght of a rest moment can also vary by the hardness of the previous pattern but this rather applys to lower difficulties.

**Example what break maps could have:**

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with 4/1 ( same break like snapping is fine in Kantan due to often being easy anyway )
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1 with 3/1 or 4/1 breaks
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with 3/4 or 2/1 breaks
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4 with 1/1 breaks

For skilled mappers / players who are having problems to distinguise when a lower difficulty becomes too hard, you can try playing your beatmap on **[<https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/T-Aiko>! T-Aiko!]** which gives you a different difficulty feeling and can show how lower player could feel when playing your maps.
