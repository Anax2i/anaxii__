## Star Rating and Web Icons

![Star Rating Range](SR_range.png "Star Rating Range")

-   From the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria):
    -   Below 1.5: Easy ![Easy icon](/wiki/shared/Easy-s.png "Easy icon")
    -   Below 2.25: Normal ![Normal icon](/wiki/shared/Normal-s.png "Normal icon")
    -   Below 3.75: Hard ![Hard icon](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard icon")
    -   Below 5.25: Insane ![Insane icon](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane icon")
    -   Above 5.25: Expert ![Expert icon](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert icon")

This is the range that decides which web icons are used depending on the star rating of any given map. Following the icon range is a good way to achieve a balanced difficulty spread. Here are some guidelines you can follow to improve the difficulty spread of your mapset.

## osu! difficulty spreads

From the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria):

> The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars.

-   Consecutive order means this is the expected full spread ![Easy icon](/wiki/shared/Easy-s.png "Easy icon") ![Normal icon](/wiki/shared/Normal-s.png "Normal icon") ![Hard icon](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard icon") ![Insane icon](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane icon") ![Expert icon](/wiki/shared/Expert-s.png "Expert icon")
-   Depending on the star rating gap several combinations of lower difficulties are theoretically allowed:
    -   ![Easy icon](/wiki/shared/Easy-s.png "Easy icon")(1.4) ![Hard icon](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard icon")(2.5) ![Hard icon](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard icon")(3.6)
    -   ![Easy icon](/wiki/shared/Easy-s.png "Easy icon")(1.4) ![Hard icon](/wiki/shared/Hard-s.png "Hard icon")(2.6) ![Insane icon](/wiki/shared/Insane-s.png "Insane icon")(3.8)

A good difficulty spread is **more than just star rating and web icons**! However, the icons help players to get a quick overview and if possible you should always aim to use them appropriately.

osu!taiko difficulty spreads
----------------------------

From the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria):

> The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars. A mapset cannot have just one osu!taiko difficulty. If you decide to include osu!taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 osu!taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty.

A common set contains the following four difficulties: Kantan, Futsuu, Muzukashii and Oni which difficulty spread between them **should be approximately kept the same**. To achieve this, it is highly recommended to set a **main snapping** for each difficulty which **follows the pace of the song**.

-   Common set: ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy")![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal")![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard")![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane")

**Example 1:** Having a main snapping through all difficulty which patterns vary depending on the pace of the song.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4

**Example 2 (what should not happen):** Difference between Oni and Muzukashii is too big which makes the entry from one to the other diff very difficult, while Muzukashii to Futsuu is denser and makes the spread inconsistent.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + **easy 1/2**
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + **demanding 1/4**
