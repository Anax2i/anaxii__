# osu!taiko

There are five difficulties a [beatmapper](/wiki/beatmapper) can [map](/wiki/beatmapping) for an osu!taiko [mapset](/wiki/mapset).
The articles below explains how to prepare a beatmap for a specific difficulty and what to be aware of in the process of making the beatmap.

## Beatmapping

A common set contains the following four difficulties: Kantan, Futsuu, Muzukashii and Oni which difficulty spread between them **should generally be kept the same**. To achieve this, it is highly recommended to set a **main snapping** for each difficulty which **follows the pace of the song**. If the spread is still uneven, you may add an additional difficulty.
Additional difficulties can be used for **fixing spread problems**. For example, if a spread happens to become too large between two difficulties, you can either try refining the existing difficulties to fit the spread or add a new difficulty if the gap between two difficulties is too large.

Make sure that every single difficulty **fits to the overall spread**.

To have an idea of how these sets can be build up, examples are given:

**Example 1:** Sometimes the snapping behaviour can shift through the diffs, depending on the songs BPM. In this case the difficulties have lower density due to a slow BPM song and does not require a Kantan since Futsuu is sufficient enough.

-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2

**Example 2:** Same snapping case as Example 1 but with the difference of having at certain places denser patterns. Good for songs which support harder mapsets.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with some 1/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1 with some 1/2
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with some 1/4
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4 with harder 1/4 or 1/6

**Example 3:** This would be a common set with an additional Inner / Ura Oni a song can carry.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4
-   ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-t.png "Expert") Main snapping 1/2 + demanding 1/4

**Example 4:** Such sets are also possible; having a common set with an additional really hard Oni for high tier players.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + easy 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + easy 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + easy 1/2
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + easy 1/4
-   ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-t.png "Expert") Main snapping 1/2 + demanding 1/4

**Example 5 (what should not happen):** While the transition from Kantan to Futsuu and Muzukashii to Oni is fine, Futsuu to Muzukashii spread happens to be bigger since Futsuu does not have any 1/2 for a better transition into Muzukashii and hence, the spread is uneven and spitted in lower and higher difficulties. Example 2 should be followed to fix such problems.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with 1/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with 1/4
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4

## Breaks in osu!taiko

[**Breaks**](/wiki/Glossary/#break) are very important in an osu!taiko beatmap and can be seen as the *hidden extra note*. They have a great influence when it is about the **difficulty** and **spread** of a mapset and can **emphasize certain places** in a map. Besides following the song, the length of a rest moment depends also of the **main snapping** in a map. So if a Muzukashii has a main snapping of 2/1 + 1/1, the breaks should be bigger than this snapping to **avoid continuous mapping**. Sometimes the length of a rest moment can also vary by how hard the previous pattern was but this would apply more to lower difficulties.

**Example what breaks maps could have:**

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with 4/1 (same break-like snapping is fine in Kantan due to it often being easy anyway)
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1 with 3/1 or 4/1 breaks
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with 3/2 or 2/1 breaks
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4 with 1/1 breaks

For skilled mappers or players who are having problems to distinguish when a lower difficulty becomes too hard, you can try playing your beatmap on **[T-Aiko!](/wiki/Game_Modes/External_Ports/T-Aiko!)** which gives you a different feeling and can show how lower players could feel when playing your maps.

**M** = Mapper

-   As the second mapper (M2), always think about **what difficulty** will fit **better** to the GD-Set. Instead of another Oni, you could add a **Futsuu** or **Inner Oni** to the set.

-   Think about lower/newer players. They are the **future for our community**, so give them easy difficulties to get used to *osu!taiko*. Experienced players can use several [mods](/wiki/Game_Modifiers/#difficulty-increasing-mods) to make the map harder for themselves.
