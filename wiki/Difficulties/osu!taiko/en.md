# osu!taiko

There are five difficulties a [beatmapper](/wiki/beatmapper) can [map](/wiki/beatmapping) for an osu!taiko [mapset](/wiki/mapset).
The articles below explains how to prepare a beatmap for a specific difficulty and what to be aware of in the process of making the beatmap.

- ![Easy icon](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png) [Kantan](/wiki/Kantan) (also known as _Easy_)
- ![Normal icon](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png) [Futsuu](/wiki/Futsuu) (also known as _Normal_)
- ![Hard icon](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png) [Muzukashii](/wiki/Muzukashii) (also known as _Hard_)

## Guidelines and Tips

A common set contains the following four difficulties: Kantan, Futsuu, Muzukashii and Oni which difficulty spread between them **should be approximately kept the same**. To achieve this, it is highly recommended to set a **main snapping** for each difficulty which **follows the pace of the song**. If the spread still happens to be uneven, you may move to another type of set which contains an additional Inner Oni and sometimes even an Ura Oni. These difficulties can be used as fillers in a mapset to ensure a consistent spread in case four difficulties are not enough.

While Inner and Ura Oni are normally in use for hard Onis, they can also be used for **fixing spread problems**. For example, if a spread happens to become too large between two difficulties, you can either try refining the existing difficulties to fit the spread or add a **new map** if the gap between two difficulties is too large to be refined.

Go back to the [Difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties/#osu-taiko-difficulty-spreads) for more examples.

**Example 1:** Sometimes the snapping behaviour can shift threw the diffs, depending on the songs BPM. In this case the difficulties have lower density due to a slow BPM song and does not require a Kantan since Futsuu is sufficient enough.

-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2

**Example 2:** This would be a common set with additional Inner / Ura Oni a song can carry.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4
-   ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-t.png "Expert") Main snapping 1/2 + demanding 1/4

**Example 3:** Such sets are also possible; having in general a common set with an additional really hard Oni for high tier players.

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + easy 2/1
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + easy 1/1
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + easy 1/2
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + easy 1/4
-   ![Expert](/wiki/shared/Expert-t.png "Expert") Main snapping 1/2 + demanding 1/4

## Breaks in osu!taiko

[**Breaks**](/wiki/Glossary/#break) are really important in an osu!taiko beatmap and can be seen as the *hidden extra note*. They have a great influence when it is about the **difficulty** and **spread** of a mapset and can **emphasize certain places** in a map. Besides following the song, the length of a rest moment depends also of the **main snapping** in a map. So if a Muzukashii has a main snapping of 2/1 + 1/1, the breaks should be bigger than this snapping to **avoid continuous mapping**. Sometimes the length of a rest moment can also vary by how hard the previous pattern was but this would apply more to lower difficulties.

**Example what breaks maps could have:**

-   ![Easy](/wiki/shared/Easy-t.png "Easy") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with 4/1 ( same break like snapping is fine in Kantan due to often being easy anyway )
-   ![Normal](/wiki/shared/Normal-t.png "Normal") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1 with 3/1 or 4/1 breaks
-   ![Hard](/wiki/shared/Hard-t.png "Hard") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with 3/2 or 2/1 breaks
-   ![Insane](/wiki/shared/Insane-t.png "Insane") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4 with 1/1 breaks

For skilled mappers or players who are having problems to distinguish when a lower difficulty becomes too hard, you can try playing your beatmap on **[T-Aiko!](/wiki/Game_Modes/External_Ports/T-Aiko!)** which gives you a different difficulty feeling and can show how lower player could feel when playing your maps.
