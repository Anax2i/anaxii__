# Beatmaps

*Not to be confused with [Difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties).*

Beatmaps are a set of difficulties in osu!. They consist of a song, multiple [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects), a background image/video, or a [storyboard](/wiki/Storyboards).

Beatmaps can be uploaded using the [BSS](/wiki/Submission) (Beatmap Submission System), then run through an approval process called [modding](/wiki/Modding), which is to maintain the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).

You can find beatmaps on the [Beatmaps Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) page, in [beatmap packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs), or using osu!direct.

## Ranked Statuses

Both ranked and approved beatmaps require approval from two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators) before they can be ranked. This can influence the stats on a player's profile, which is what makes them different from a [pending](/wiki/Glossary#pending) or [graveyarded](/wiki/Glossary#graveyard) beatmap.

### Ranked

Ranked beatmaps use the double upwards chevron icon (![Double upwards chevron icon](/wiki/shared/status/ranked.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps ideally fulfill the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria). This is to ensure that most players can expect a certain standard while playing them.

### Approved

Approved beatmaps use the check icon (![Check icon](/wiki/shared/status/approved.png)) in the song select screen.

The approved status is typically for songs that are over five minutes in length (also known as a [marathon](/wiki/Glossary#marathon)), measured with the total [drain time](/wiki/Glossary#drain-time) of a beatmap. Most approved beatmaps do not have easy or normal difficulties. However, some creators may upload them as separate beatmapsets with identical songs while some are included inside a ranked song, containing ranked beatmaps.

### Qualified

Qualified beatmaps use the checkmark icon (![Checkmark icon](/wiki/shared/status/qualified.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps are in the last stage of the beatmapping and modding process. Before the beatmap begins playing, a dialogue will display, noting the status of the beatmap:

- No [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_Points) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted when the status is changed.
  - If the status is changed to ranked, approved, or back to pending; all scores will be wiped!

When a beatmap is qualified, it passed the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria), and has been approved by two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). Qualified beatmaps is the last line of defense as they are required to be in this status for one week before becoming ranked/approved permanently.

During the one week duration, however, [Quality Assurance Team members](/wiki/Glossary#quality-assurance-team) are allowed to write issues with the beatmaps. If this happens, the beatmapset's status will go back to pending and the process starts over again.

### Loved

*For history of the Loved category, see: [History of Loved](/wiki/Beatmaps/History_of_Loved).*

Loved beatmaps use the heart icon (![Heart icon](/wiki/shared/status/loved.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps may not meet the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria), but are *loved* by the community and thus are regularly added based on community votes so that they have a leaderboard. Before the beatmap begins playing, a dialogue will display, noting that:

- No [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_Points) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted if the creator updates the beatmap.

For a beatmap to be in the Loved category, it must first go through the [community voting process](/wiki/Project_Loved#moving-a-beatmap-to-loved).

### Pending

*Main page: [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_Ranking_Procedure)*

Pending beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/pending.png)) in the song select screen.

A beatmap with a pending status is usually waiting to be [modded](/wiki/modded). [Creators](/wiki/Creators) must seek for [modders](/wiki/Glossary#modder) from the community and at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators) to get their beatmapset out of this status.

Inactive beatmaps that have been in this category for 4 weeks are automatically moved into the [graveyard](/wiki/Glossary#graveyard) status.

All pending beatmaps do not affect user statistics.

### Graveyard

Graveyarded beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/graveyard.png)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps were initially pending, but are moved to this status because they have not been updated or its thread post was inactive for 4 weeks (28 days). These beatmaps cannot be updated until the [mapper](/wiki/mapper) revives it by updating the beatmap in the in-game editor.

All graveyarded beatmaps don't affect user statistics.

For the sake of having digital space for newer beatmaps, osu! will purge graveyarded beatmaps if they have been in this status for a long period of time.
