# Hyperfruit

A *hyperfruit* is an effect that can be generated on a [fruit](/wiki/Hit_object/Fruit) or [drop](/wiki/Hit_object/Juice_stream#drop). This effect will be generated when the next fruit or drop can't be caught with normal dashing. The movement that is created when catching the hyperfruit is called a [hyperdash](/wiki/Glossary/Hyperdash). This effect will also generate when the last [banana](/wiki/Hit_object/Banana) of a [spinner](/wiki/Hit_object/Spinner) can't be caught with a dash.

During play, this effect is characterized by a coloured outline on the hyperfruit.
