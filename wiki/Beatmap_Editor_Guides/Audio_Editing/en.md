[osu!academy](/wiki/Announcements/osu!academy) covered this in [Episode 15: Audio Encoding (4:02)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muu3HkG38kk). It also contains how to install and use Audacity with LAME's .mp3 export ability.

This article serves as guide to help you editing your audio files for beatmapping purposes. By expanding it, you can help fellow beatmappers to create suitable audio files for any need.

Audio Encoding
--------------

The process of changing the bitrate of a .mp3. Usable bit rates range from 128 kbps up to 192 kbps so as to ensure that audio quality is kept within the limits of the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).

In some cases, mappers own a .mp3 with higher bit rates (usually 320 kbps or 256 kbps) that need to be lowered using a third-party software to fit in the allowed range for their maps to be rankable.

Lowering Bitrate with Audacity
------------------------------

[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/) is a open source free audio editing software.

It requires the [LAME](http://lame.sourceforge.net/) .mp3 encoding library to be able to export sound files in the .mp3 format and using different bit rates. [To install LAME on Audacity, refer to Audacity wiki](http://wiki.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Lame_Installation#Windows_Instructions). Once installed you can now edit .mp3 formats and when exporting the file, you can change in the options before encoding to set a VBR or CBR and the bit rate to 128, 192, etc.

When looking for music to map for osu!, there are tons of great free use audio portals such as [Newgrounds](http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com), [OCRemix](http://ocremix.org/), and [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com/) that offer free music to use under [Creative Commons](Creative_Commons).
