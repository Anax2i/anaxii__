# Rules

The rules listed here affect what Beatmap Nominators can and cannot do when nominating beatmaps as well as set the tone for the general conduct expected from them. 

These rules are the result of discussion within the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) and have taken into account feedback from the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nomination_Group) upon their proposal.

Beatmap Nominators possess the tools to nominate beatmaps and shape the world of osu! by promoting new content towards being included in the official listings, for this reason they have to abide by the following rules at all times:

## Rules

Rules are exactly that: **rules.** Violating any of these may get the respective Beatmap Nominator removed permanently from the Beatmap Nominators.

Violations of those rules may be reported to a member of the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/People/Quality_Assurance_Team) directly.

### General

+ **__Every__ mapset is approved through two nominations.** Other factors such as the mapset itself being a Marathon, a normal spread or its length do not matter, the amount of nominations required in order to move it to the Qualified section remains at two. More nominations than necessary must not be done.
+ **Do not nominate your own map, a collab map you participated in or a map you made a storyboard for.** The entire modding process is focused around others ensuring that your map is ready for ranking, so doing this counteracts common sense.
+ **Do not nominate a map directly without any communication with the mapper.** The mapper might have done self-changes after the last icon, so nominating a mapset without communicating with the mapper can lead to pointless disqualifications.
+ **Do not qualify osu! beatmaps of any kind unless you are a nominator in the osu! advanced tier.** This includes osu! and another mode hybrid sets. When nominating hybrid sets including modes you are not too familiar with as an advanced tier nominator, collaborate with a nominator from the respective gamemode(s).
+ **Do not nominate beatmaps of game modes you are not formally qualified for.** You must be qualified to nominate at least one of the game modes included in the mapset by being a member of the respective part of the Beatmap Nominators in order to be allowed to nominate it.
+ **Do not nominate maps with unrankable issues.** The General Ranking Criteria and additionally all mode-specific Ranking Criteria apply to all sets with mode-specific difficulties.
+ **Do not qualify mapsets that use the same song or a different version of the same song as an already Qualified mapset, unless no game modes of both sets overlap.** For example an osu!taiko and osu! mapset of the same song can exist in Qualified, while a taiko and osu!/taiko hybrid set cannot. This ensures variety among Ranked beatmaps within their respective game modes.
+ **If a bubbled map contains unrankable issues, its bubble must be popped.** To ensure a map has no other unrankable issues, it is best for another Nominator to examine the map once again.
+ **You must not rebubble a map when your bubble was popped without the popper agreeing to that action.** In these cases another nominator may rebubble the map if they disagree with the bubble pop.
+ **There must be at least 24 hours between placing a bubble and qualifying a mapset.** This is to give other members of the community and Beatmap Nominators a bit of time to think about whether they want to veto the placed bubble.
+ **Do not qualify over any manually popped bubble.** A manually popped bubble resets the bubble counter to zero, so doing this is equivalent to directly qualifying a beatmap without any prior icons.

### Conduct

+ **Do not nominate a beatmap if you are unsure of something.** In such cases, ask fellow nominators for assistance before making any rushed decisions. This includes unfamiliar game modes, suspiciously gray area/unrankable issues, quality issues or complex timing.
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap if you cannot reasonably judge it.** Being able to reasonably play a beatmap is a core part of being able to judge a beatmap’s quality. If you are multiple tiers below the playing level of the map we may call your ability to judge it into question.
+ **Do not qualify a beatmap if anything significant on the beatmap got changed since it was bubbled.** If you want to qualify directly, make sure that the changes made were minor and that you rechecked your changes with the original bubbler. When in doubt, rebubble such beatmaps.
+ **Do not follow any unfinalized rules or amendments.** Only act upon the set of rules that is currently in effect, the rules of tomorrow are uncertain so they should not be followed.
+ **Make sure no mod posts in the map thread have been ignored before qualifying or bubbling a map.** Posts without a sufficient reply may count as ignored. When in doubt, double check if the Code of Conduct for Mapping and Modding has been violated on the mapthread and act accordingly.
+ **Ensure that kudosu is awarded to all posts that deserve it.** Additionally consult the mapper before giving out kudosu to make sure there are not any reasons why the post does not need kudosu (e.g. the modder has received one already for a different post which you overlooked). If the modpost is too old to receive kudosu, consult the modder to make an additional post linking the original he receives kudosu for.
+ **When nominating a Marathon mapset, always qualify the map first and then post the flame on the mapthread.** Pressing "Qualify" will automatically put a heart icon on the beatmap thread, and since the last icon is displayed posting the flame first will be overwritten by the heart. You are required to post a heart or flame in any case for logging reasons, though.
+ **Do not nominate a beatmap without properly checking all difficulties of the beatmap all by yourself.** If you are unfamiliar with the game mode some of the difficulties are mapped in, ask fellow Nominators for help. Improper checking includes just running a modding tool before nominating or not even downloading the beatmap. While difficult to prove, such behavior will be handled as inappropriate conduct.
+ **You can veto a beatmap set by placing a bubble pop on the set that you disagree with being fit for being Ranked.** Bubble popping over any kind of quality issues that you think need to be addressed before the map can move anywhere is one of your main responsibilities. A proper discussion with attempting to reach a mutual agreement by both sides of the argument has to follow.
+ **You are free to pop a rebubble of another nominator if you are not the original bubble popper and disagree with the reasoning for disregarding the bubble pop.** Thus the original popper is unable to overvote two other nominators.
+ **If the community member(s) requesting disqualification cannot reach an agreement with the mapper and you placed the last bubble or heart on a map, you cannot rebubble or requalify it.** For osu!taiko, osu!catch, osu!mania, and hybrid sets, you may break these conditions once per map due to the low number of nominators.
+ **Do not violate the terms of services or the [_osu!_ Community Rules](/wiki/Rules) and the [Code of Conduct for Modding and Mapping](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Code_of_Conduct).** Misbehaving in public can and will get you expelled from the Beatmap Nominators.
+ **Do not nuke beatmaps in any case.** While you are able to set this icon, nuking a beatmap indicates that it is “so wrong” that it will never reach a rankable state and should hence not be used by Nominators. If you accidentally set the icon, contact a QAT immediately or overwrite the icon in case you wanted to post a bubble or heart.
