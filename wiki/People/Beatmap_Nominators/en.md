Beatmap Nominators
========================

The **Beatmap Nominators** are a group in charge of [beatmap nomination](/wiki/Submissions/Beatmap_Ranking_Procedure). Individual members are sometimes referred to by the acronym *BN*.

Formerly, they were considered as part of the volunteer moderation team. On the 22nd of August, 2014, they were split from their moderation duties to focus completely on the modding and ranking process.

The Beatmap Nominators is split into two tiers based on their level of proven expertise. These two tiers have different privileges and responsibilities.

At the moment, **only the osu!standard Beatmap Nominators are split according to tiers.** Other gamemodes will receive their tier splits at a later date.

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

![The Nominator Badge](Nominator.png "The Nominator Badge")

The **Beatmap Nominators** are responsible primarily for [modding](/wiki/Modding) the [pending beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) into the ranking cycle.

BNs are the people to go to for any modding or advice requests about anything mapping or modding related.

In modes that have not yet had a tier split (osu!taiko, osu!catch, osu!mania), the BN are responsible for both bubbling and qualifying maps.

Otherwise:

Tier 1 or 'beginner' BN can only bubble maps. They may not qualify them.

Tier 2 or 'advanced' BN have proven experience and expertise with their given gamemodes, and may qualify maps as well as bubble them.

Becoming a Beatmap Nominator
----------------------------

Applications to join the Beatmap Nominators open periodically in irregular cycles. When applications are open, a topic will be sticked to the top of the [Pending Beatmaps Subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/6) announcing the process by a member of the [Quality Assurance Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/g/7)

### What do I need to become a Beatmap Nominator?

Modders that aim to apply to the Beatmap Nominators must fulfill the following criteria:

+ They have been modding beatmaps actively for at least 3 months prior to the announcement.
+ They have accumulated at least 50 [kudosu](/wiki/Glossary/#kudosu) in total.
+ They must have met a minimum mod and kudosu score threshold for the past few months. This is explained further below.
+ They must collect 3 to 5 mod posts that they believe outline their skill and proficiency at modding to present to the QAT during the application process.

### What exactly qualifies as a 'mod post'?

Any post in a beatmap's thread qualifies as a 'mod post' if it has received kudosu, and has been created within the time span listed on the submission form.

### What is mod and kudosu score, and how is the minimum threshold calculated?

In order to determine their minimum required score, an applicant needs to summarise both their kudosu score and their mod for the three month period that encompasses each application window.

A mathematical formula is used to determine both kudosu and mod score.

Kudosu score is determined according to the following formula:

![Kudosu Score Formula](/wiki/shared/KDSCORE.png "Kudosu Score Formula")

Mod score per month is determined according to the following formula:

![Mod Score Formula](/wiki/shared/MODSCORE.png "Mod Score Formula")

+ The overall minimum threshold is set to the following values:
  + osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania: 1050
  + osu!: 1100

It is usually a good idea to keep your score well above these numbers as they can vary slightly depending on the amount of applicants.
