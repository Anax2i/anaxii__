# Contest Committee

*For tournaments, see: [Tournament Committee](/wiki/People/Tournament_Committee).*

The **Contest Committee** is a panel of skilled and established mappers and modders in the community.

Their responsibilities include:

- Observing the mapping and modding community and advising the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) on a case-by-case basis
- Regularly reviewing the [Official beatmapping contest support](/wiki/Contests/Official_support) page for revisions where necessary

## How can I help contribute?

You can help the contest committee by continuing to run excellent beatmapping contests!

Those who are interested in joining the contest committee may express their interest by sending an email to the [account support team](/wiki/People/Account_support_team) via [tournaments@ppy.sh](mailto:tournaments@ppy.sh), where requests are forwarded to the committee. Successful candidates are expected to have a significant breadth of experience in mapping and modding.
