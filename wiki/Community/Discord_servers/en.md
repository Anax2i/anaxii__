# Discord servers

This article lists various [Discord](https://discord.com/) servers that have been created and maintained by the osu! community to host discussion spaces about the game's many different facets. Some are focused on the management of specific projects, while others are more general, but most of them include casual chat channels regardless.

## Official osu! server

The **osu!** Discord server, previously known as **osu!dev**, is osu!'s official Discord server for development-related purposes. The server functions as a hub for people to discuss and work on osu!'s open source and community projects. This is the main place to contribute to osu!'s development and get in touch with the [osu! team](/wiki/People/osu!_team).

**This is the only server officially affiliated with the game.** To keep up with osu!'s active development, it is strongly suggested to join the server.
