Beatmap Ranking Procedure
============================

When a beatmapset is first made, it is in the Pending or Work in Progress sections. These maps are referred to as "unranked". Unranked maps do not have a scoreboard and go to the Graveyard section after a 28 day period of inactivity. In order for a map to have a scoreboard and to be moved to the "Ranked" section, a map must go through the beatmap ranking process. First it must get nominated twice to get qualified and then ranked after around 7 days in the Qualified section. Only BNs and QATs can bubble and subsequently rank a beatmap.

Nominations 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In order for a [beatmapset](/wiki/Glossary/#beatmapset) to receive a nomination, it must follow and be in accordance with the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and must have at least 5 hypes. Hypes can be opbtained by having other users hype your beatmap in the Discussion page of the map, or under the map's description. Once a beatmap has at least 5 hypes, a BN can nominate it if they feel it meets two conditions:

1.  The beatmapset meets the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).
2.  The beatmapset meets overall quality standards that are not part of the Ranking Criteria.

Nomination Reset
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updating a nominated beatmapset will cause the nomination count to be reset. This means it will need to be nominated again. Alternatively, a nomination can be reset by another BN or QAT, if either the beatmapset does not follow one or more rules in the Ranking Criteria or the BN has issues with the quality of the map. If a beatmapset is reset due to quality standards not part of the Ranking Criteria, then it is called a veto. Vetos are dealt with mediation by the QAT. 

Note: In the case of a minor change to a nominated beatmapset, then the BN can nominate the beatmapset again immediatly, but in the case of a veto, a decision from the QAT needs to be done before the map is allowed to be nominated again.

Qualified and Ranked Sections
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once a beatmapset reaches two nominations, it will reach the Qualified section. While in the Qualified seciton, the map will gain a leaderboard, but will not award [Performance Points](/wiki/Performance_Points). The reason two Beatmap Nominators are required to check a map is because human beings make mistakes, and this greatly reduces the likelyhood of a map making it through the ranking system with a drastic error. If a map gets qualified but an unrankable issue is found or improvements to be beatmapset have been proposed and accepted, then it will be disqualified by a QAT member. This resets the nominations on the map. 

Once a map is in the Qualified section for around 7 days, it will be automatically moved to the Ranked section. If a map is disqualified, the 7 day timer is not reset, meaning if a map is disqualified after 4 days, once it is qualified again it will need 3 days before being moved to ranked. After the map has been moved to the Ranking Section, it will be there permanently and the map will award [Performance Points](/wiki/Performance_Points).
