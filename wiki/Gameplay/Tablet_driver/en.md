# Tablet driver

A **tablet driver** is a specific type of [device driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver "Wikipedia"), a piece of software that allows physical peripherals to communicate with a computer, made for [graphics tablets](/wiki/Input_device/Graphic_tablet). Most commonly, these drivers are made by the manufacturer of the tablet (e.g. Wacom, Huion, XP-Pen), and thus have added functionalities and polishing fit for the product. But these drivers can also be made by unofficial groups, who often distribute their drivers as [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source "Wikipedia").

A list of the most popular open source drivers are listed below:

- [hawku/TabletDriver](https://github.com/hawku/TabletDriver "Github") (commonly shortened to "hawku driver" or just "hawku")
- [Devocub/TabletDriver](https://github.com/Devocub/TabletDriver "GitHub") (commonly shortened to "devocub driver" or just "devocub")
- [OpenTabletDriver](https://github.com/InfinityGhost/OpenTabletDriver "Github")

## Controversy

Because manufacturers like Wacom and Huion are brands that are primarily aimed towards graphic art design, and not rhythm games, many users have called into question the [latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering) "Wikipedia") and effectiveness of their drivers for use in osu!. Many of these users have also criticised the inflexibility of manufacturer-provided drivers for uses outside of graphic design, and have even reported issues of major lag regarding inputs on their tablets.

However, it should be noted that many users find their opinions on the contrary, stating that they are perfectly comfortable with their drivers and do not see a noticeable latency. Some have even claimed that they find open source alternatives to be clunky or just do not fit their personal needs.

The common consensus among most players is that the choice of driver depends heavily on the specific combination of hardware that a user is running, and the personal preference of the user.
