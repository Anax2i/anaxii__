# Ranked score

*For other uses, see [Score (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Score).*

The **ranked score** is the total sum of the best scores for all ranked difficulties played online.

 - History  (6 October 2007 â€“ 24 July 2012)

Before ppv1 and ppv2, ranks were defined by the amount of ranked score a person had. The #1 ranked player would change frequently due to how small osu! was at the time and the lack of maps. Ranked score was fully replaced by ppv1 as of July 24 2012, which was later to be replaced by ppv2 on 27 January 2014.

## Approved beatmaps

Approved was a category for beatmaps that awarded a huge amount of score (eg. Marathons). Approved beatmaps didn't award any ranked score however awarded Total Score and pp. Alternatively, Loved maps are maps that don't award pp however award Ranked and Total score.
