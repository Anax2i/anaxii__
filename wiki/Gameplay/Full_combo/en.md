# Full combo

**Full combo** (or *FC* for short) is a term used to describe a player passing a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmap) without ever combo breaking. Full combos are scored by passing a beatmap with no misses<!-- TODO: link --> or [sliderbreaks](/wiki/Gameplay/Judgement/Slider_break).

Scores that lost combo only via dropped slider ends are widely considered by the community to be full combos. This differs from the game client and website's display.

Because the [score](/wiki/Gameplay/Score) of an individual object in [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) heavily depends on combo multiplier and is virtually unbounded, full combos typically award the most score in these game modes.

# Perfect full combo
**Perfect full combo** (or *PFC* for short) is a term used to describe the game acknowledging a full combo ocurred by coloring the combo green. This is crucial for Hush-Hush medals, as whenever they are checking for the full combo conditional directly, it is referring to a perfect full combo. In all 4 game modes, Standard, Taiko, Catch, and Mania, the way this is technically processed varies:

Standard - Pass a beatmap with no misses, sliderbreaks, or dropped slider ends.

Taiko - Pass a beatmap with no misses. The beatmap must not contain sliders/drumrolls or spinners/dendens/shakers. Taiko skill medals however allow sliders/drumrolls or spinners/dendens/shakers.

Catch - Pass a beatmap with no misses.

Mania - Pass a beatmap with no misses, 50s, or 100s. Mania skill medals however allow 100s.
