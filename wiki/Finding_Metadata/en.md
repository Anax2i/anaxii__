The metadata in a osu!beatmap is imperative as it defines the artist, the song name, the genre, and any other
essential information a player needs to know about the song.


## Gathering a song's basic information

First step is finding the basic information of the song's metadata in a music/video streaming platform
service, like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) or [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) or searching at [Google](https://google.com).

A little more research is needed to gather their metadata. Only trust metadata from **official sources**.

## Entering the metadata

Once done getting all the needed information, you have two options to enter the metadata to.

#### A : via Song Setup.
