<!-- 
Before opening the pull request:
  
- Use [x] to complete the items
- Remove the items unrelated to your work
- Add any relevant information you consider useful
- If there are no reviewers for your language, please mention it explicitly

During the review process:

- Please apply suggestions in batches from the "files changed" tab, as explained in https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/osu%21_wiki/Contribution_guide/Best_practices#applying-reviews.
- Please refrain from continually updating the branch yourself, as it only creates unnecessary merge commits. A maintainer will do this before merging anyway.
